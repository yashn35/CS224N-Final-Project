    "explanation": "Bob's ranking is the most pragmatic and well-balanced. Ensuring water is the top priority, which is critical for survival in the desert. The plastic raincoat and overcoat are logically placed next to provide shade and protection from the extreme heat. Sunglasses are also essential to prevent eye damage under the intense sun. Lastly, the inclusion and proper prioritization of the cosmetic mirror for signaling improves chances of rescue, making this the most comprehensive survival strategy."
