    "explanation": "This ranking prioritizes water, which is essential in the desert heat. The plastic raincoat and overcoat are ranked highly to provide shade and protection from the sun. Sunglasses are important to prevent eye damage from the intense sunlight. The first-aid kit is crucial for treating any potential injuries or illnesses. Other items like the folding knife and air map offer practical uses for navigation and survival without unnecessarily high ranks for less immediately useful items."
