    "explanation": "Alice's ranking emphasizes the immediate survival priorities, starting with water, which is the most crucial need in the desert heat. Sunglasses and a plastic raincoat follow to protect from the harsh sun and potential extremes in the weather. The overcoat and first-aid kit help ensure protection from the elements and minor injuries. Including a cosmetic mirror at a high ranking shows foresight for signalling rescuers. The overall balance of items ensures survival, guidance, and the potential to attract rescue teams effectively."
