Water is critical in a desert environment, and protecting eyes from intense sunlight with sunglasses is very important to prevent vision impairments. The plastic raincoat can help create shade or collect condensation. A cosmetic mirror can be used for signaling potential rescuers. Lastly, the first-aid kit is crucial for addressing any injuries or ailments that arise."
