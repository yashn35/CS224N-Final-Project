    "explanation": "I chose Daisy's ranking because it prioritizes water, which is essential for survival in the desert. The plastic raincoat is ranked second, which can be used for multiple purposes such as protection from the sun, creating shade, or collecting dew. A cosmetic mirror is ranked high, which is crucial for signaling potential rescuers. Sunglasses are also a priority, protecting our eyes from the intense sun. The first-aid kit is ranked fifth, ensuring that we can handle any immediate medical needs."
