The large plastic raincoat can serve multiple functions including protection from the sun and potential water collection. Ranking the first-aid kit third ensures immediate medical needs can be addressed promptly. Sunglasses and overcoats provide essential protection against the harsh sun and temperature fluctuations, which are immediate threats in the environment. The practical balance between hydration, health, and protection from environmental hazards makes Alice's ranking the most effective for survival."
