    "explanation": "Alice's ranking is the most balanced, focusing on immediate survival needs without overlooking tools for rescue and navigation. Water is rightly prioritized given the intense heat, ensuring hydration. The plastic raincoat is vital for creating shade and collecting condensation, while the cosmetic mirror can signal rescuers effectively. Sunglasses and the first-aid kit address health and safety, ensuring protection against the environment and potential injuries. This thorough approach supports both immediate and longer-term survival, making it a comprehensive plan."
