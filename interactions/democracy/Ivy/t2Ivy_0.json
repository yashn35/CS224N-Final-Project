    "explanation": "Charlie's ranking is the most practical for immediate survival and eventual rescue. Prioritizing water, a first-aid kit, and sun protection items like the plastic raincoat and sunglasses are crucial to surviving the extreme heat and treating any potential injuries. The parachute and cosmetic mirror are essential signalling tools that could greatly aid in rescuing the group. The folding knife and torch are versatile tools for various tasks and emergencies. Lastly, the inclusion of practical items like maps and clothing ensures that longer-term survival needs are also considered."
