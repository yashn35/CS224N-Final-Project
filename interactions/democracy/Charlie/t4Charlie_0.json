    "explanation": "I picked Alice's ranking because water is the most crucial item in the desert, and she ranked it first. The plastic raincoat can help with protecting against the sun and collecting condensation for extra water. The first-aid kit is essential for treating any injuries or illnesses that may arise in the harsh desert environment. Sunglasses protecting our eyes from the intense sun is also a priority. Lastly, the overcoats can help with temperature regulation, offering some insulation during cooler desert nights and additional shade during the day."
