A cosmetic mirror for signaling and a first-aid kit for medical emergencies are also wisely prioritized. Overall, Bob's logical prioritization of hydration, protection from the elements, and essential survival tools provides a well-rounded approach to increasing the group's chances of survival and rescue."
