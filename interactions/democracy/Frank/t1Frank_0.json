    "explanation": "Alice's ranking is pragmatic and prioritizes the most critical needs. Water is correctly placed at the top since hydration is essential in the desert heat. Sunglasses protect against harsh UV rays, while the raincoat and mirror can be used for shelter and signaling respectively. The inclusion of the first-aid kit ensures basic medical needs are covered. Overall, her ranking balances immediate survival concerns with practical tools for navigation and signaling."
