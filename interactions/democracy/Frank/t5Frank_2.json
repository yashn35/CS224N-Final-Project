    "explanation": "Eve's ranking systematically addresses the primary survival needs in the Atacama Desert. Water is rightly placed at the highest priority to prevent dehydration. The plastic raincoat's versatility for creating shelter from the sun makes it a smart second choice. Essential tools like the folding knife and first-aid kit ensure utility and medical readiness. Sunglasses, the torch, air map, and compass further aid in navigation and protection, creating a well-rounded plan."
