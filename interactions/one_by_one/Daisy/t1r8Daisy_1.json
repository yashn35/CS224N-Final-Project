    "explanation": "Protecting our eyes from the intense UV rays in the Atacama Desert is crucial to avoid vision impairment or blindness, which would impede our navigation and survival. Sunglasses will help maintain our ability to see clearly and efficiently search for resources and paths to the mining camp. Without proper eye protection, the risk of accidents and being unable to find our way increases significantly."
