    "item": "A cosmetic mirror",
    "explanation": "The cosmetic mirror is the most important item because it provides the best chance of signaling for help by reflecting sunlight, which is critical in the vast and barren Atacama Desert. The reflective surface can create highly visible signals over long distances, significantly increasing the chances of being spotted by search teams or passing aircraft. This capability to attract attention directly impacts our likelihood of rescue and survival."
