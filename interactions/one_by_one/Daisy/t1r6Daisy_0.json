    "explanation": "The 2 litres of 180 proof liquor can be vital for survival because it can be used as a disinfectant for any wounds, reducing the risk of infection in the harsh desert environment. Additionally, it can serve as a fire starter, which could be crucial for signaling rescuers or for warmth during the cooler desert nights. Water distillation might also be possible using some of the alcohol, providing a potential source of safe drinking water if properly managed."
