    "item": "Parachute (red & white)",
    "explanation": "The parachute is the most important item because its visible colors can attract attention from rescue teams or passing aircraft, increasing our chances of being found quickly. In addition to its signaling utility, the fabric can provide essential shade and help prevent overheating in the intense desert heat. The multifunctionality of the parachute, offering both protection from the elements and a way to signal for help, makes it a critical survival tool in the harsh conditions of the Atacama Desert."
