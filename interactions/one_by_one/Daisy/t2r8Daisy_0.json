    "explanation": "In a barren and extremely sunny environment like the Atacama Desert, protecting your eyes from the intense sunlight is crucial. Sunglasses will help prevent vision impairment and reduce the risk of sunstroke and dehydration caused by squinting and overexposure to the sun's rays. Proper vision is essential for navigation and spotting potential sources of shelter, water, or assistance."
