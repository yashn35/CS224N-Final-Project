    "item": "Torch with 4 battery-cells",
    "explanation": "In the desert, the temperature drops significantly at night, and the area becomes extremely dark, making it challenging to navigate and spot potential hazards or shelters. The torch with battery cells can provide critical illumination, helping us to conserve energy during the cooler night hours and use the time to move towards safety. Furthermore, the torch can be used for signaling at night, potentially attracting the attention of rescuers or the mining camp 50 miles away."
