    "item": "A cosmetic mirror",
    "explanation": "In the isolated and barren environment of the Atacama Desert, the ability to signal for help is paramount because it greatly increases the chances of being rescued. The cosmetic mirror can reflect sunlight over long distances, making it possible for search parties or passing aircraft to locate your group despite the vast and flat terrain. Efficient signaling is essential in a situation where your exact position is unknown, and immediate rescue is necessary due to the extreme temperatures and lack of resources."
