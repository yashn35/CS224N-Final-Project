    "explanation": "The red and white parachute can serve as a crucial signaling device to help rescuers locate your group from the air or over long distances in the vast desert. Its bright colors will stand out against the barren landscape, increasing the chances of being spotted. Additionally, the parachute fabric can provide essential shade, a critical protection against the extreme heat."
