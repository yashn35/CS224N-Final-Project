    "explanation": "The torch with battery cells is crucial because it can serve as a signaling device for rescue teams. The high temperatures and lack of water make daytime travel dangerous, so navigating at night becomes necessary for survival. Additionally, the torch can be used for illumination in the dark, helping to avoid potential hazards and navigate safely."
