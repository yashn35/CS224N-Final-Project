    "explanation": "The 2 litres of 180 proof liquor is critically important because it can serve multiple life-saving functions. First, it can be used as a disinfectant for any wounds, which is crucial in a desert environment where medical help is far away. Additionally, the liquor can help conserve water as it can be used to dampen clothing, which will aid in cooling through evaporation."
