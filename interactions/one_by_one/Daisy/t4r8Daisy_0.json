    "explanation": "The intense sunlight in the Atacama Desert can cause severe eye damage and impair vision, making it difficult to navigate or perform necessary survival tasks. Sunglasses will protect your eyes from the harsh UV rays, reducing the risk of snow blindness and allowing you to see clearly. This can be crucial for spotting landmarks, searching for water sources, and maintaining group coordination."
