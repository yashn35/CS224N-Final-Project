    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoat is crucial for protection against the extreme heat in the desert during the day and the potentially cold temperatures at night. By covering your body, you can reduce the risk of sunburn and severe dehydration due to excessive sweating. Additionally, the overcoat can be used to create makeshift shade or shelter, helping to maintain a lower core body temperature and to conserve energy."
