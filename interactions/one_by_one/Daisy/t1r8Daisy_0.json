    "explanation": "The harsh sun and extreme temperatures in the Atacama Desert can cause severe eye damage and dehydration if proper eye protection is not used. Sunglasses will help prevent snow blindness and other eye-related issues, allowing everyone to function more effectively and move towards the mining camp. Proper vision is crucial for navigation, spotting any potential sources of water, and avoiding hazards such as sharp cacti."
