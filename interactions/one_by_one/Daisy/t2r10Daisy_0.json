    "explanation": "A cosmetic mirror can be used to signal for help by reflecting sunlight towards potential rescuers, aircraft, or distant settlements. In a desert environment where survival depends on being located quickly, the ability to create highly visible signals is critical. Furthermore, the mirror can help in navigation and maintaining orientation by reflecting sun positions."
