    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoat is critically important as it provides protection from the extreme daytime heat and the significant drop in temperature at night, reducing the risk of heatstroke and hypothermia. It also helps prevent sunburn and further dehydration by shielding the skin from direct sunlight, which is paramount in a desert environment. Additionally, the overcoat can be used to catch dew at night, potentially providing a small amount of water."
