    "item": "2 litres of 180 proof liquor",
    "explanation": "The 2 litres of 180 proof liquor is the most important item for our collective survival. In extreme heat conditions, dehydration is a major threat, and while the liquor itself cannot hydrate us, it can be used for other purposes. The liquor can be used as a disinfectant for potential wounds, a fire starter if needed, and even diluted with water to create a drinkable solution in emergencies."
