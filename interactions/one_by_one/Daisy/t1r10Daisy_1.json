    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoat is critical for protection against the extreme temperatures in the Atacama Desert, shielding you from the sun's harsh rays and preventing heatstroke and sunburn. It can also help conserve body moisture by reducing direct exposure to the sun, which is crucial given the limited water resources available. Additionally, the overcoat can offer warmth during the cold desert nights and can be used as a makeshift shelter or signaling device."
