    "explanation": "The cosmetic mirror is the most important item as it can be used for signaling rescue planes or ground search parties, significantly increasing the chances of being found. Reflecting sunlight with the mirror can create highly visible signals over long distances, even in the harsh desert environment. This significantly enhances our ability to communicate our location to rescue teams."
