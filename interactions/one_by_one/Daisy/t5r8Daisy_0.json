    "explanation": "Surviving in extremely high temperatures requires protection from the harsh sun and heat. The overcoat can help prevent sunburn, dehydration, and heatstroke by providing shade and lowering the risk of direct sun exposure. Additionally, it can serve as a means to conserve body moisture and offer some insulation against cold nighttime temperatures."
