    "explanation": "In the harsh environment of the Atacama Desert, a torch with battery cells is critical for signaling rescue parties during the night or navigating in the dark safely. The intense heat during the day makes it necessary to rest and conserve energy, meaning travel might be more efficient during cooler evening hours when such a torch would be invaluable. Additionally, the batteries can potentially be used in other creative ways to signal for help."
