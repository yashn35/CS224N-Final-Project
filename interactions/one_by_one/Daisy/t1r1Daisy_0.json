    "item": "2 litres of water per person",
    "explanation": "Water is the most critical resource in a desert environment where temperatures can soar to 130 F. Dehydration occurs rapidly in extreme heat, and without water, survival beyond a day or two is highly unlikely. Having 2 litres of water per person will provide necessary hydration and potentially buy time for rescue or for making a trek to the mining camp."
