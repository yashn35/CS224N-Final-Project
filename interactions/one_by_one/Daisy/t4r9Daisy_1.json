    "explanation": "In the intense heat of the Atacama Desert, the overcoats will provide essential sun protection during the day, preventing heatstroke and severe sunburn. Additionally, they will help to insulate and retain warmth during the drastically cooler nights, mitigating the risk of hypothermia. The multifunctional use of the overcoats for both daytime and nighttime conditions makes them critical for survival in the harsh desert environment."
