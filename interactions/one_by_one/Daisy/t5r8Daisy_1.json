    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoat is crucial for protection against the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert, as it can provide necessary shade and reduce the risks of sunburn and heatstroke. It also serves an additional role by offering insulation during the potentially cold desert nights, making it a versatile survival tool. Furthermore, the overcoat can be used to create makeshift shelters, giving the group a way to manage their body temperature and exposure to the harsh environment."
