    "item": "Sunglasses (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "Given the harsh conditions of the Atacama Desert and the intense sunlight, protecting our eyes from the sun's glare is critical. Without sunglasses, the risk of eye damage or impaired vision is high, which would jeopardize our ability to navigate and survive. Sunglasses will help prevent extreme discomfort and potential vision problems, allowing us to focus on finding resources and shelter."
