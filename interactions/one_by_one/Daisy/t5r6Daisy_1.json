    "explanation": "The parachute (red & white) is crucial for survival as it provides shade to help prevent heatstroke and dehydration in extremely high temperatures. Its bright colors increase the chances of being spotted by rescue teams from a distance, enhancing the likelihood of a successful rescue. Additionally, the material can be used to collect dew or condensation, providing a potential source of water in the arid desert environment."
