    "item": "Parachute (red & white)",
    "explanation": "The brightly colored parachute can be used as a signaling device to attract rescuers, which is crucial given the vast and barren landscape of the Atacama Desert. Its large surface area makes it highly visible from the air, increasing our chances of being spotted. Additionally, the parachute can provide shade from the intense sun, helping to prevent heatstroke or dehydration."
