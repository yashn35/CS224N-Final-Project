    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoat is the most important item because it can provide critical protection against the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert. By wearing the overcoats during the hottest parts of the day, you can reduce the risk of heat stroke and dehydration, which are immediate threats to your survival. Additionally, the overcoats can help conserve body moisture and provide some insulation against the cold desert nights."
