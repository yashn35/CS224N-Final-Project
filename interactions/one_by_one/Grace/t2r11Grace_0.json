    "explanation": "The 2 litres of 180 proof liquor is the most important item for survival. Given the intense heat and the likelihood of severe dehydration, the liquor can be diluted with found water to sterilize it, making it safer to drink. Additionally, the high alcohol content can be used for medical purposes, such as disinfecting wounds or starting a fire for signaling or warmth at night."
