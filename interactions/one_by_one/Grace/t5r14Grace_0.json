    "item": "45 calibre pistol (loaded)",
    "explanation": "The pistol may serve multiple survival functions, including defense against potential threats and as a signaling device for rescuers. Though salt tablets are important for preventing dehydration, the immediate need for protection and the ability to send distress signals is crucial in the barren environment of the Atacama Desert. Even without immediate threats, the psychological security the pistol provides can help maintain calmness and clear decision-making."
