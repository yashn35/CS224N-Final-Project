    "item": "Cosmetic mirror",
    "explanation": "The cosmetic mirror is the most important item because it can be used to signal for help by reflecting sunlight to potential rescuers. Given the flat and barren landscape of the Atacama Desert, signaling with a mirror can be effective over long distances. The intense sunlight in the desert will amplify the visibility of the reflected signals, which significantly increases the chances of being seen by search parties or passing aircraft."
