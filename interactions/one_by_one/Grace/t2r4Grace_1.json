    "explanation": "The magnetic compass is essential for navigation in the vast and barren Atacama Desert, allowing us to maintain a steady direction towards the mining camp. Proper navigation minimizes the risk of getting lost, conserves our limited energy resources, and reduces exposure time in the extremely harsh environment. Given the lack of landmarks and the severe heat, the ability to move efficiently towards safety significantly increases our chances of survival."
