    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoat is the most important item because it provides essential protection against the extreme heat and the intense sun exposure in the Atacama Desert, preventing sunburn and heat exhaustion. It can also be used during the cooler night temperatures to retain body heat. Furthermore, it can be utilized as a makeshift shelter by placing it over a frame, providing much-needed shade during the hottest parts of the day."
