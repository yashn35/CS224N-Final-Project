    "explanation": "The first-aid kit is crucial for addressing any medical emergencies or injuries that might occur during the journey to safety. Even though no one is injured now, the harsh conditions in the Atacama Desert pose risks such as dehydration, sunburn, and heat exhaustion, which the first-aid kit can help mitigate. Additionally, having medical supplies available provides a sense of security and enables us to address health issues promptly."
