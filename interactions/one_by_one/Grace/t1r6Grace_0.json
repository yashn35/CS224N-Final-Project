    "explanation": "In the extreme heat and glaring sun of the Atacama Desert, protection from the sunlight is crucial for maintaining visibility and preventing eye damage. The sunglasses will help everyone in the group reduce the risk of sun-related eye damage and maintain their ability to navigate the barren terrain effectively. Without them, the intense sunlight could impair your vision and make it more challenging to find the mining camp, putting everyone's survival at greater risk."
