    "item": "45 calibre pistol (loaded)",
    "explanation": "The pistol can be used for protection against any potential dangers such as wild animals or other threats in the desert. It can also serve as a signal device to attract attention from rescuers by firing shots into the air. Given the scarcity of resources, it might also be useful for hunting small game to sustain ourselves."
