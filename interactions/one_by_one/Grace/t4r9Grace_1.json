    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "In the extreme heat and cold of the Atacama Desert, the overcoat serves as a crucial multipurpose tool for survival. It provides necessary protection from the sun during the day, reducing the risk of heatstroke and severe sunburn, and it helps retain warmth during nighttime temperature drops, mitigating the risk of hypothermia. Ensuring continuous protection against the elements is essential for conserving energy and sustaining the group's ability to travel the 50 miles to the mining camp."
