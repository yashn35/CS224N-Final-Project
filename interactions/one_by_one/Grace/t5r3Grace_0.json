    "item": "2 litres of 180 proof liquor",
    "explanation": "The 2 litres of 180 proof liquor can be used primarily for starting a fire, which is vital for signaling and potentially purifying water, should you find any. It can also be used as a rudimentary antiseptic for treating any injuries that may occur. Given the extreme temperature and barren conditions, being able to signal for help is one of your highest priorities, and the liquor increases your chances of being seen by search parties."
