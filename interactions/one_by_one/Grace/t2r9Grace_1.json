    "explanation": "Protecting your eyes from the intense sunlight in the Atacama Desert is crucial to prevent vision impairment, which is essential for effective navigation. The harsh UV rays and glare can cause severe discomfort and temporary blindness, both of which would compromise the group's chances of survival. Sunglasses help ensure clear visibility and maintain overall health, allowing the group to focus on finding resources and reaching the mining camp safely."
