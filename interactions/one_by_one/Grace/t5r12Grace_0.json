    "explanation": "The folding knife is the most versatile tool available and will be crucial for multiple survival tasks such as preparing food, crafting shelter, and protection. Though there is a pistol available, its utility is limited without additional ammunition and the potential dangers it poses could outweigh its benefits. The knife's utility encompasses both immediate survival needs and longer-term tasks that will be necessary until rescue."
