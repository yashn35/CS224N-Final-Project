    "explanation": "The torch with battery-cells is crucial because it will help signal for rescue during nighttime or low visibility conditions. Light is a universal distress signal and can attract attention from rescuers who may be searching for you. Additionally, a torch can help you navigate safely during the night if you need to leave the crash site to find help."
