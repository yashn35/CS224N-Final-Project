    "explanation": "The cosmetic mirror can be used to signal for help, which is crucial in a vast and barren desert where visual contact with rescuers is your best chance of being found. The bright sunlight in the Atacama Desert can be reflected over long distances, increasing the likelihood of attracting attention. It's a versatile tool that also requires no physical exertion to use, ensuring you conserve energy and stay hydrated in the extreme heat."
