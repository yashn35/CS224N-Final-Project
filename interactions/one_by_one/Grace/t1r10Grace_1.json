    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "In the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert, protecting oneself from the harsh sun is essential to prevent heatstroke and dehydration. The overcoats will provide shade and help conserve body moisture, which is critical given the high temperatures and scarce water supply. Additionally, they can offer warmth during the cold desert nights, thus aiding in overall survival."
