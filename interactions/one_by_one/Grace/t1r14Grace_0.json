    "item": "45 calibre pistol (loaded)",
    "explanation": "The pistol can be used for signaling for help in the vast and barren area, as discharging it can produce a loud noise that travels far. It can also provide defense against any potential threats, whether animal or human, that may arise in this perilous environment. Survival in remote deserts often requires means of protection and signaling, making the pistol a multi-purpose survival tool."
