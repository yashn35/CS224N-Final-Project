    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoat can provide essential protection from the extreme heat and harmful UV radiation of the desert sun, helping to prevent heatstroke and sunburn. It could also be used to collect dew or condensation overnight, providing a small but potentially crucial amount of water. In the event of a significant temperature drop at night, the overcoat can help retain body heat, preventing hypothermia."
