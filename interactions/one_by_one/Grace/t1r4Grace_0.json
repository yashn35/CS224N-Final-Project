    "explanation": "In the intense heat of the Atacama Desert, dehydration is a critical concern. The 2 litres of 180 proof liquor can be used for its high alcohol content to serve as an antiseptic, which is essential for treating any potential wounds in a harsh environment. Additionally, the liquor can be diluted with water to create a sterilizing solution, helping to ensure any available water is safe to drink."
