    "explanation": "The overcoat provides essential protection against the harsh desert sun and extreme temperatures. It can help prevent heatstroke and sunburn, allowing us to conserve our energy and water resources. Additionally, it can be used to create shade, enhancing our ability to endure the extreme heat until rescue arrives or we reach the mining camp."
