    "explanation": "The plastic raincoat is vital for creating a solar still, providing a method to produce drinkable water which is essential in the harsh desert environment. Additionally, it can offer shade and protection from the intense heat, helping to prevent heatstroke and dehydration. Water is critical to survival in these conditions, and securing a consistent source dramatically increases our chances of making it to safety or surviving until rescue."
