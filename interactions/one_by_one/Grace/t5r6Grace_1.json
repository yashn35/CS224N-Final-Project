    "explanation": "The parachute can serve multiple crucial functions in this extreme desert environment. Its bright red and white material can act as a highly visible signal for rescue teams searching from the air. Additionally, it can provide much-needed shade from the sun, preventing heatstroke and dehydration, and can even be used to collect dew for water."
