    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoats are vital because they offer protection from both the harsh daytime sun and the cold night temperatures in the Atacama Desert, which is critical for preventing heatstroke, dehydration, and hypothermia. Additionally, they can be used to create shade during the day and provide warmth at night, ensuring better temperature regulation. The fabric can also be utilized for other survival purposes, such as collecting dew or signaling for rescue."
