    "item": "Torch with 4 battery-cells",
    "explanation": "The torch with 4 battery-cells is the most important item as it can be used for signaling rescuers at night and potentially scare off wild animals. The batteries can also be used as a source of energy for other survival tricks, like starting a fire. Visibility and the ability to signal for help are crucial in such a barren and dangerous environment."
