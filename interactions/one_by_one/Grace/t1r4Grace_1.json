    "explanation": "The magnetic compass is essential for reliable navigation in the featureless Atacama Desert. Without a clear sense of direction, the risk of wandering aimlessly increases dramatically, leading to faster depletion of vital resources like water. Navigating directly towards the mining camp significantly boosts our chances of reaching help and reduces exposure to the extreme heat."
