    "explanation": "In the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert, dehydration is a significant risk due to the high temperatures and potential for excessive sweating. Salt tablets are essential in preventing hyponatremia, which can occur when the body's electrolytes, particularly sodium, are depleted through sweat. By maintaining electrolyte balance, the salt tablets can help sustain physical and cognitive functions critical for survival and any attempt to reach the mining camp."
