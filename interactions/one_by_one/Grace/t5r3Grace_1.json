    "explanation": "The plastic raincoat can be used to create a solar still, which is essential for obtaining drinking water in the arid environment of the Atacama Desert. In the extreme heat, hydration will be critical for survival, and the lack of water sources makes this makeshift solution the highest priority. Additionally, it can also provide shade or protection from the sun, reducing the risk of heatstroke."
