    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoat will provide crucial protection against the harsh sun, which is essential to prevent heatstroke and severe sunburns in the extreme temperatures of the Atacama Desert. The clothing you are wearing is too lightweight to offer sufficient protection. Additionally, the overcoats can be used to retain warmth during the cold desert nights, which will help in conserving body heat and energy."
