    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "In the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert, the overcoat can be used to create makeshift sunshade or shelter, protecting your group from the intense sun and potentially life-threatening heat. It can also help retain warmth during the cold desert nights, mitigating the risk of hypothermia. Ensuring protection against the sun is critical to prevent heatstroke and conserve energy for the 50-mile trek to the mining camp."
