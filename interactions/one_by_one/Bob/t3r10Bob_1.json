    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "In the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert, protection from the sun is vital to avoid heatstroke and severe sunburn, which can be life-threatening. The overcoats provide essential shade and can reduce the risk of dehydration by minimizing perspiration. Additionally, they can be used as makeshift shelters during breaks or to retain body heat during the cooler desert nights, enhancing our chances of survival."
