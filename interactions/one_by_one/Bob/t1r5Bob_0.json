    "item": "Torch with 4 battery-cells",
    "explanation": "The torch with 4 battery-cells is the most important item because it can be used to signal for help during nighttime when temperatures are lower, and rescuers or others are more likely to see the light. The batteries can also be repurposed for other survival techniques such as starting a fire for warmth or cooking. In the harsh desert environment, having a reliable light source can significantly improve your chances of being found and surviving."
