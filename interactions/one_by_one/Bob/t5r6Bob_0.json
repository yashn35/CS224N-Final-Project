    "item": "Parachute (red & white)",
    "explanation": "The parachute can provide shade, helping to prevent heatstroke and dehydration in the extreme desert heat. Its bright colors can also serve as a signal for search and rescue teams, increasing the chances of being spotted from a distance. Additionally, it can be used to collect dew or trap moisture at night, potentially providing a small amount of water."
