    "item": "A cosmetic mirror",
    "explanation": "The cosmetic mirror is the most important item for survival because it can be used to signal for help and attract the attention of rescue parties or aircraft. Its reflective surface can generate a glint visible from a long distance, which is crucial given that your position was not communicated prior to the crash. Given the vast, barren desert terrain, the ability to signal for help significantly increases your chances of being found and rescued."
