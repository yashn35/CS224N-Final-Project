    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoat provides essential protection from the extreme heat during the day by offering shade, which helps prevent heatstroke and sunburn. It also serves as insulation during the cold desert nights, maintaining body temperature and reducing the risk of hypothermia. Ensuring protection against both intense sun and cold temperatures is crucial for survival in the harsh climate of the Atacama Desert."
