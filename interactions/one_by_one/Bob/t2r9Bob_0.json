    "explanation": "The Atacama Desert's intense sunlight can cause severe eye strain and long-term damage, making navigation and survival much more difficult. Good vision is essential for both finding food and water sources and for heading in the right direction toward the mining camp. Sunglasses will protect your eyes from UV radiation, reducing the risk of sun blindness and allowing for clearer visibility in the harsh desert environment."
