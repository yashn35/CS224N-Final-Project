    "explanation": "The bright colors of the parachute make it an excellent signaling device for rescue teams, significantly increasing the chances of being located. It can also provide much-needed shade to protect against heatstroke and dehydration in the harsh desert environment. Additionally, the large material could be used to collect dew or condensation overnight, offering a potential water source."
