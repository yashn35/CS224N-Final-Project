    "item": "2 litres of 180 proof liquor",
    "explanation": "The 2 litres of 180 proof liquor is the most important item because it can be used as a disinfectant for any potential injuries, which is critical in a survival situation. Additionally, the alcohol can be diluted with water to create a sterilizing solution for any water you might find, reducing the risk of waterborne illnesses. The liquor can also serve as a fire starter, which is essential for warmth during the cold nights in the desert and for cooking any available food."
