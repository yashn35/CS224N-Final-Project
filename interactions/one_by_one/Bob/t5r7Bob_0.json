    "explanation": "The parachute can provide crucial shade from the intense sun, significantly reducing the risk of heatstroke and dehydration. Its bright colors will also make it easier for search and rescue teams to spot from the air, increasing your chances of being found. Lastly, the parachute's fabric can be used to collect dew or as a makeshift tent for shelter."
