    "item": "A cosmetic mirror",
    "explanation": "The cosmetic mirror is the most important item because it can be used to signal for help and attract the attention of rescue parties or aircraft. Given the barren and flat landscape of the Atacama Desert, the ability to reflect sunlight and generate a visible signal over long distances significantly increases your chances of being found. Efficient signaling is critical, especially when your position was not communicated prior to the crash and immediate rescue is necessary to survive in extreme temperatures."
