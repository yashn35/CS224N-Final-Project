    "explanation": "The plastic raincoat can be used to create a solar still to generate drinking water from condensation, which is crucial for survival in the desert. Dehydration is a major threat in high-temperature environments, and having a method to produce water daily greatly increases chances of survival. Additionally, the raincoat can provide shade, reducing sun exposure and thus lowering the risk of heatstroke."
