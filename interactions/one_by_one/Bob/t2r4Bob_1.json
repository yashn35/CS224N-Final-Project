    "explanation": "Navigational tools are critical in vast and barren landscapes like the Atacama Desert, where landmarks are minimal. A magnetic compass will help you maintain a consistent direction towards the mining camp, which is essential given the intense temperatures and lack of water sources. Without proper navigation, you risk wandering aimlessly and depleting your limited energy and resources, reducing your chances of survival."
