    "explanation": "Protecting your eyes from the intense sun is critical to prevent damage and retain good vision. The Atacama Desert's UV index is extremely high, making eye protection essential for navigating and enduring the conditions. Without sunglasses, the glare and harsh light could significantly impair your ability to move towards safety and locate resources, which is vital given the distance to the nearest known settlement."
