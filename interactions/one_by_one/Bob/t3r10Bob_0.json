    "explanation": "The 2 litres of 180 proof liquor is the most important item for survival in the Atacama Desert. Alcohol can be used as a disinfectant for any wounds, and it can also aid in purifying water if found, making it safer to drink. Additionally, the high proof liquor can be used to start a fire, which is critical for signaling for rescue and potentially cooking any food found in the environment."
