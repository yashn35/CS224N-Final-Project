    "explanation": "The magnetic compass is the most vital item for ensuring accurate navigation to the mining camp, our closest source of potential rescue. The featureless and harsh environment of the Atacama Desert makes it easy to lose one's sense of direction, dramatically reducing survival chances without proper guidance. With the compass, we can maintain a consistent direction towards our goal, ensuring efficient use of our limited resources and increasing the likelihood of reaching help."
