    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoat can provide crucial protection against the extreme desert temperatures and potential sunburn during the day and help retain body heat when the temperature drops at night. Staying cool during the day and warm at night is essential for survival in the harsh desert environment. While other items could be useful, maintaining body temperature is immediately critical to prevent heatstroke and hypothermia."
