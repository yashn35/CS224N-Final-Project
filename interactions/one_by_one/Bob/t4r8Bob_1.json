    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoats offer essential protection against both the extreme heat during the day and the cold temperatures at night. They can reduce the risk of heatstroke and sunburn by minimizing direct sun exposure, and provide insulation when the temperature drops. Additionally, using overcoats to create makeshift shelters or shade can help conserve energy and water resources, crucial for our survival in the harsh desert environment."
