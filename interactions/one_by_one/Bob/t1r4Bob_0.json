    "explanation": "The magnetic compass is the most crucial item for ensuring that you can navigate your way to the mining camp, which is the nearest known settlement and potential source of rescue. Being lost in a desert without a clear sense of direction significantly reduces your chances of survival, given the extreme temperatures and lack of resources. With the compass, you can maintain a consistent direction towards your goal, making the journey more efficient and increasing your likelihood of reaching help."
