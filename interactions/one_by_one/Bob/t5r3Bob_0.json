    "explanation": "In the intense heat of the Atacama Desert, preventing dehydration and maintaining a cooler body temperature is critical. The plastic raincoat can be used to create a makeshift shelter to provide shade from the sun, reducing the risk of heatstroke. Additionally, it can potentially be used to collect and retain any condensation, providing a minimal but crucial source of water."
