    "explanation": "In the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert, hydration is the most critical factor for survival. The 180 proof liquor can be used as a disinfectant for any injuries and, when diluted, can help in sanitizing limited water sources. It also can be used for signaling purposes if you manage to start a fire, increasing your chances of being found."
