    "explanation": "The plastic raincoat can be used to create a solar still, which is essential for producing drinkable water in the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert. Water is critical for survival, and the ability to produce it increases our chances of making it to the mining camp or being rescued. Additionally, it can provide shade and protection from the sun, helping to prevent heatstroke and dehydration."
