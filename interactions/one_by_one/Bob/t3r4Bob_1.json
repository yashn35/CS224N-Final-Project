    "explanation": "The magnetic compass is crucial for maintaining a consistent and accurate direction towards the mining camp, which is 50 miles away. In the vast and featureless terrain of the Atacama Desert, proper navigation is essential to avoid disorientation and ensure efficient travel. Accurate orientation will save energy, mitigate the risk of dehydration, and significantly increase our chances of reaching help in such extreme conditions."
