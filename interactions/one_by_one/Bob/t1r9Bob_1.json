    "item": "A cosmetic mirror",
    "explanation": "The cosmetic mirror is essential for signaling rescuers by reflecting sunlight, which can be seen from a considerable distance. In the vast and barren Atacama Desert, this significantly increases the chances of being found and rescued promptly. While the overcoat is useful for extreme temperatures, immediate visibility to potential rescuers is a higher priority for survival."
