    "explanation": "The torch with battery-cells is essential for signaling at night and is crucial for navigation after sunset in the vast barren desert. It can be used to attract search parties or nearby settlements that might be around the area since night visibility can be limited. Additionally, the batteries could be used to power other potential electrical needs or makeshift communication devices."
