    "explanation": "Maintaining electrolyte balance in extreme heat is crucial for survival to prevent heat exhaustion and heat stroke, especially in the Atacama Desert where temperatures can reach dangerous levels. The salt tablets can help retain water in your body, meaning that any available water you find or consume will be more effectively utilized. This preserves vital hydration in a harsh environment where dehydration could quickly become fatal."
