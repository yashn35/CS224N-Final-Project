    "explanation": "In a survival situation where distance to the nearest settlement is known, navigation becomes critically important. The air map will help us identify landmarks and orient ourselves towards the mining camp, increasing our chances of being found and rescued. Without proper navigation, we risk wandering aimlessly in the extreme heat, which could be fatal."
