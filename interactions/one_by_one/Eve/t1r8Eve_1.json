    "explanation": "Protecting our eyes from the harsh UV rays and intense glare of the Atacama Desert is crucial for maintaining our vision and navigation abilities. Eye damage or temporary blindness would severely hinder our chances of successfully finding our way to the mining camp. Sunglasses ensure that everyone can see clearly, reducing the risk of accidents and allowing us to focus on survival."
