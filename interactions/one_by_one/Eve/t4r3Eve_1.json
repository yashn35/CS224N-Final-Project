    "explanation": "In the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert, the plastic raincoat can be used to create a solar still to collect water, which is vital for survival. Hydration is the most critical aspect to consider in a desert environment due to the high risk of dehydration. Additionally, the raincoat can provide temporary shade to reduce exposure to the sun, preventing sunburn and heatstroke."
