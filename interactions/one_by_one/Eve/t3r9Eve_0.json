    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The temperature in the Atacama Desert can drop drastically at night, leading to hypothermia if you are unprepared. An overcoat will provide protection against these temperature extremes, which is crucial for survival. Additionally, during the day, the overcoat can be used to create shade, helping to reduce the risk of heat exhaustion and sunburn."
