    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoat is the most important item as it offers protection against the extreme heat, preventing sunburn and heat stroke. It can also help to retain moisture in the body by reducing direct exposure to the sun. Additionally, it can serve as a makeshift shelter during the peak heat of the day or be used to signal rescuers."
