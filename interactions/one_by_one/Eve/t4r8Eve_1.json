    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoat is the most important item because it provides essential protection from the intense sun during the day, thereby reducing the risk of heatstroke and dehydration. It can also offer insulation during the cooler night temperatures, maintaining body warmth. Furthermore, overcoats can be used to create makeshift shelters or shade, significantly enhancing our chances of surviving until we reach the mining camp or get rescued."
