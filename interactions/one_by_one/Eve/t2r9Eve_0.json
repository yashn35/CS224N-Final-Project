    "explanation": "The extreme sunlight in the Atacama Desert can cause eye damage and impair vision, which is crucial for navigating the harsh environment. Sunglasses will help protect everyone's eyes from UV rays, reducing the risk of sun blindness and increasing the chances of successfully reaching the mining camp. Although other items can be useful, maintaining clear vision is fundamental for both immediate survival and making rational decisions."
