    "explanation": "In extreme heat, salt tablets can be crucial in preventing dehydration and heat exhaustion by helping maintain electrolyte balance when sweating profusely. Although it is important to consume them with ample water, having electrolytes is essential in such harsh conditions. Without proper electrolyte balance, you risk severe dehydration and heatstroke, which can be life-threatening in the desert environment."
