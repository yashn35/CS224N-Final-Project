    "explanation": "In the Atacama Desert, signaling for rescue is crucial due to the remoteness and extreme temperatures. A cosmetic mirror can reflect sunlight to attract attention from rescuers or passing aircraft, significantly increasing the chances of being found. Given that your position is unknown and immediate rescue is essential, efficient signaling is the priority for survival."
