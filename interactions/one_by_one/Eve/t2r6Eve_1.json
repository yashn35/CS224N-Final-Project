    "explanation": "The air map of the area is crucial for navigation, especially since you are 50 miles from the nearest settlement and off your planned course. It will help you plot a precise route to the mining camp, minimizing the risk of getting lost in the vast and desolate Atacama Desert. Without this map, the chances of surviving such a hostile environment and reaching safety would be significantly reduced."
