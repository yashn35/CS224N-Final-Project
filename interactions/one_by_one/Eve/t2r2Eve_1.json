    "item": "Plastic raincoat (large size)",
    "explanation": "The plastic raincoat is essential as it can be used to create a solar still, allowing the conversion of air moisture into drinkable water, which is critical in the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert. It also provides shade and protection from the sun, helping to prevent heatstroke and dehydration. Ensuring a water supply greatly increases our chances of survival and the potential to reach the mining camp or be rescued."
