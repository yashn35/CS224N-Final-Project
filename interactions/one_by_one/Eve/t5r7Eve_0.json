    "explanation": "In the barren expanse of the Atacama Desert, the bright colors of the parachute can be used to signal for help and enhance visibility to rescuers. Additionally, it can be used to provide much-needed shade, reducing the risk of heatstroke under the extreme desert sun. Given the scarcity of immediate resources and the high temperatures, increasing the chances of being spotted quickly is crucial for survival."
