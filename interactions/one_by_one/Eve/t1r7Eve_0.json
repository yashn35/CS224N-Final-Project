    "item": "Parachute (red & white)",
    "explanation": "The red and white parachute can serve as a highly visible signal to attract rescuers who may be searching for you from the air, thus increasing your chances of being found.

Finally, the material can be repurposed for various survival needs, such as carrying items or wrapping up injured people."
