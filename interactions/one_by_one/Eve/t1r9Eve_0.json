    "item": "Cosmetic mirror",
    "explanation": "The cosmetic mirror is the most important item for collective survival because it can be used to signal for help. Given the vast and barren nature of the Atacama Desert, being able to create a reflective signal can increase the chances of being spotted by rescuers significantly. Additionally, reflecting sunlight can help conserve energy and avoid wandering away from the crash site."
