    "explanation": "Salt tablets can help to replace the essential electrolytes lost through sweat, which is critical to avoid dehydration and heat exhaustion in such extreme temperatures. Even though water is more essential, salt tablets can help maintain sodium levels in your body, preventing cramps and other heat-related issues. Given the high temperatures and the body's rapid loss of salts, having these tablets is crucial for maintaining some level of physical function and endurance as you try to reach help."
