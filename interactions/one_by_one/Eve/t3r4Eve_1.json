    "explanation": "The magnetic compass is essential to ensure we maintain an accurate and consistent direction towards the mining camp, which is critical in the featureless and disorienting landscape of the Atacama Desert. Without the compass, the risk of wandering off course significantly increases, which could lead to further dehydration and exhaustion. Accurate navigation will optimize our energy and water use, increasing our chances of survival in such extreme conditions."
