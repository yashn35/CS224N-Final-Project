    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoats can help protect everyone from the extreme heat during the day, reducing the risk of severe sunburn and heatstroke. They can also provide some insulation against the cold desert night temperatures, which can drop dramatically. Additionally, they can be used as makeshift shelters to create shaded areas, further helping to manage body temperature and minimize exposure to the harsh environmental conditions."
