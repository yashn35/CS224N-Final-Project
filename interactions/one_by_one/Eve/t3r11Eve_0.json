    "explanation": "The overcoat is crucial for survival as it can provide protection from the extreme heat during the day and the cold temperatures at night. Furthermore, it can be used to create shade, reduces the risk of heatstroke, and can help preserve body moisture. In an environment as harsh as the Atacama Desert, managing exposure to the elements is vital to maintain energy and hydration levels."
