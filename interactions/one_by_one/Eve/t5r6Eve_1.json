    "explanation": "The parachute's bright colors are crucial for signaling rescue teams, increasing the chances of being spotted from a distance in the vast desert. It can provide essential shade, helping to prevent heatstroke and dehydration in the extreme temperatures. Additionally, its large material can be used to collect morning dew or condensation, providing a potential water source in such a harsh environment."
