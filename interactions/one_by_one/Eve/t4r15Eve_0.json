    "item": "Bottle of 1000 salt tablets",
    "explanation": "In the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert, your body will lose a significant amount of salt through sweat, which is critical to maintain bodily functions and prevent heat exhaustion. The salt tablets can help replenish this lost sodium, potentially preventing severe dehydration and maintaining necessary electrolyte balance. While they do not replace water, they can help manage the effects of high temperatures when used correctly with any water that might later be found."
