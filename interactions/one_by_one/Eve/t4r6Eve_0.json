    "item": "Parachute (red & white)",
    "explanation": "The red and white parachute is the most important item because its bright colors can help signal any rescuers or passing aircraft to your location in the vast, barren desert. Given that you are 50 miles from the nearest settlement and off-course, visibility can make all the difference in being found. Additionally, the parachute fabric can provide shade to help protect you from the extreme heat or even be used to collect dew, which can provide a small amount of water."
