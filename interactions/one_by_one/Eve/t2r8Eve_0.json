    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoats are the most important item because they offer protection from the intense heat of the sun, which is critical to avoiding heatstroke and severe sunburn in this extreme desert environment. Despite the high temperatures, wearing overcoats can help keep your body temperature regulated by providing a barrier against direct sunlight. Additionally, they can be used to keep warm during the cold desert nights, ensuring protection in varying temperature conditions."
