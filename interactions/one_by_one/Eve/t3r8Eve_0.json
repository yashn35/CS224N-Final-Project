    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoats are crucial for survival because they can provide protection against the intense heat during the day and the cold at night. Proper clothing can help prevent sunburn, heatstroke, and dehydration by reducing direct sunlight exposure. Additionally, the overcoat can be used to collect dew during the night, providing a potential source of water."
