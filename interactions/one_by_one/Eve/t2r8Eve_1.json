    "explanation": "Overcoats are crucial in the desert because they can provide protection from the intense daytime heat, reducing the risk of heatstroke and sunburn. They also offer insulation during the cold desert nights, ensuring warmth and preventing hypothermia. Additionally, overcoats can be used to create shade shelters and help conserve body moisture, which is vital for survival in this harsh environment."
