    "item": "A cosmetic mirror",
    "explanation": "A cosmetic mirror is the most important item for survival because it can be used to signal for help. In the vast and barren environment of the Atacama Desert, visual signals are one of the most effective ways to attract attention from rescuers or passing aircraft. The mirror's reflective surface can catch sunlight and be seen from miles away, increasing the chances of rescue in such a desolate area."
