    "explanation": "The air map of the area is crucial for navigating the vast and featureless Atacama Desert, helping us reach the mining camp, our nearest known settlement, 50 miles away. Without any navigation aid, finding the camp would be akin to finding a needle in a haystack, significantly reducing our chance of survival. The map can also indicate landmarks or natural features where we may find water or shelter."
