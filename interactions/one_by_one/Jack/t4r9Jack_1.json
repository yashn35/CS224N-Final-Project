    "explanation": "The overcoat provides dual functionality crucial for survival: shade from the intense desert sun during the day, preventing heatstroke and sunburn, and insulation against the cold temperatures at night. These protective measures are essential in maintaining core body temperature and overall well-being in such an extreme environment. Additionally, the overcoats can be used to create makeshift shelters or coverings if needed."
