    "explanation": "The cosmetic mirror is crucial for survival as it can be used to signal for help by reflecting sunlight, significantly increasing the chances of being spotted by rescuers. In the harsh conditions of the Atacama Desert, immediate rescue is essential due to the extreme heat and lack of water. The mirror's ability to create visible signals from afar could be a lifesaver in such a barren and vast environment."
