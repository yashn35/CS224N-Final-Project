    "item": "Bottle of 1000 salt tablets",
    "explanation": "In extreme heat, the body loses salt through sweating, which is essential for maintaining fluid balance and nerve function. The salt tablets will help prevent dehydration and heat exhaustion, which can be fatal in the harsh environment of the Atacama Desert. While they won't provide hydration directly, they will help retain what little water your body has and make any future water intake more effective."
