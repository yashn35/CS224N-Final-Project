    "explanation": "In the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert, preventing dehydration is crucial, and creating shade is a vital way to stay cool and reduce water loss through sweating. The plastic raincoat can be used to create a makeshift shelter to provide some much-needed shade from the intense sun. Furthermore, it can also function as a means to collect condensation during the dramatic temperature drops at night, providing a potential source of water."
