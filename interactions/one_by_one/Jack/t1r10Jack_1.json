    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoat is essential for protecting yourself from the extreme temperatures in the Atacama Desert. It will provide shade and help to reduce the risk of heatstroke by shielding you from the sun's harsh rays. Additionally, the overcoat can help conserve body moisture, which is critical in an environment where dehydration is a major risk."
