    "explanation": "The desert sun's intense glare and high UV radiation can severely damage your eyes, leading to impaired vision which could be dangerous for navigation. Sunglasses will protect everyone's eyes, allowing the group to travel more effectively and safely. Clear vision is essential to spotting landmarks, potential water sources, or signs of human activity and ensuring safe travel towards the mining camp."
