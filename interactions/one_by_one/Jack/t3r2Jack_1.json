    "explanation": "Given the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert, preventing dehydration is critical, and having shade is necessary to stay cool and minimize water loss through sweating. The plastic raincoat can be utilized to create a makeshift shelter to provide essential shade from the intense sun. Additionally, it can be used to collect condensation during the significant temperature drops at night, which may provide a crucial source of water."
