    "explanation": "The Atacama Desert is known for its intense sunlight, and in combination with the high temperatures, the risk of sun damage to the eyes is very high. Sunglasses will protect everyone's eyes from UV radiation, reducing the risk of vision impairment which is crucial for navigating the harsh environment. Maintaining good vision is vital for spotting potential sources of rescue, water, or shelter."
