    "explanation": "The overcoat is crucial for survival as it provides essential protection against the extreme heat of the day, reducing the risk of sunstroke, heat exhaustion, and severe sunburn. It can also offer warmth during the significantly cooler nights in the desert, preventing hypothermia. Additionally, the overcoat serves multiple functions such as being used for makeshift shelters or barriers against sand and wind, making it a highly versatile and lifesaving item."
