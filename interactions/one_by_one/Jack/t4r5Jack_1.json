    "explanation": "The magnetic compass is crucial for navigation in the barren and featureless Atacama Desert. With the compass, your group will be able to maintain a consistent heading towards the mining camp, 50 miles away, ensuring you don\u2019t waste energy and resources. This directional certainty significantly increases your chances of reaching civilization and finding help before succumbing to the extreme desert conditions."
