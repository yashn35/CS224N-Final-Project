    "explanation": "The parachute (red & white) serves multiple critical purposes in a survival scenario. Its bright colors can be used to signal for help in the vast and barren Atacama Desert, increasing the chances of rescue. Additionally, it can provide shade from the intense sun, which is essential to prevent heatstroke and dehydration in such an extreme environment."
