    "explanation": "The magnetic compass is crucial for navigation in the vast, featureless Atacama Desert, ensuring we maintain a consistent direction towards the mining camp 50 miles away. Proper navigation minimizes the risk of getting lost, conserves energy, and increases our chances of finding help quickly. This is essential given the extreme temperatures and lack of water, as wandering aimlessly would likely lead to dehydration and heat exhaustion."
