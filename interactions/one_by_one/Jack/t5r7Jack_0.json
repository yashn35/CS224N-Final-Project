    "item": "Parachute (red & white)",
    "explanation": "The parachute is the most important item as its bright colors can serve as a highly visible signal for potential rescuers searching by air. Additionally, it can provide shade to protect against the intense sun, helping to prevent heat stroke and dehydration, which are critical in such extreme temperatures. Lastly, fabric from the parachute could be repurposed for various survival needs, including makeshift shelter or bandages."
