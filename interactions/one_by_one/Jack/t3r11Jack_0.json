    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoat is the most important item because it offers protection against the scorching sun, which can prevent dehydration and heatstroke. At midday temperatures of 130 F at ground level, sheltering your skin from direct sun exposure is crucial for survival. Additionally, the overcoat can be used to protect against the cold desert nights, offering warmth when temperatures drop drastically."
