    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoats are crucial for protecting against the harsh sunlight and extreme heat during the day, significantly reducing the risk of heatstroke and severe sunburn. They will also provide necessary insulation during the cold desert nights, preventing us from succumbing to hypothermia. Furthermore, overcoats can be used to create shade and minimize sun exposure, conserving body moisture which is essential for survival in a desert environment."
