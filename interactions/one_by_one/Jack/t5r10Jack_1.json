    "item": "A cosmetic mirror",
    "explanation": "The cosmetic mirror is the most important item because it allows for signaling for help by reflecting sunlight over long distances. Given the vast, barren, and extremely hot environment of the Atacama Desert, attracting the attention of rescue teams or passing aircraft is critical for survival. Its ability to catch and direct sunlight makes it an invaluable tool to increase the chances of being located quickly."
