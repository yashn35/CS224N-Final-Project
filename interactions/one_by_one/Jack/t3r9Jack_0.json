    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoat is crucial as it can provide necessary protection from the intense sun and reduce the risk of heatstroke by keeping our bodies shielded from direct sunlight. It can also be used to create shade or as a makeshift shelter, which is vital in an environment with temperatures reaching 130 F at ground level. Additionally, the overcoat could serve as insulation against the cold desert nights, helping to prevent hypothermia."
