    "explanation": "The cosmetic mirror is essential for signaling rescuers in the vast expanse of the Atacama Desert, where visibility can make a significant difference in rescue efforts. The reflective surface can attract attention over long distances, increasing the chances of being spotted by passing aircraft or search parties. Additionally, using the mirror to signal for help conserves energy and avoids the dangers associated with attempting to traverse the harsh desert environment on foot."
