    "explanation": "The 2 litres of 180 proof liquor is the most important item because it can be used to disinfect wounds and for basic medical needs. Additionally, it can be used as a fire-starting aid in case you need to signal for rescue or cook food. Lastly, the alcohol can be diluted with water and used conservatively to help with hydration in desperate situations."
