    "item": "45 calibre pistol (loaded)",
    "explanation": "The pistol can be used for signaling for help, scaring away potential predators, and for protection. While salt tablets could help with electrolyte balance, the immediate threats to survival include the need for help and protection in an uninhabited area. The ability to attract attention and ensure safety outweighs the benefits provided by salt tablets in this scenario."
