    "item": "A cosmetic mirror",
    "explanation": "The cosmetic mirror is the most important item because it can be used to signal for help by reflecting sunlight. In the vast and barren Atacama Desert, being able to catch the attention of search and rescue teams or nearby planes and vehicles dramatically increases the chances of being found. Its utility as a signaling device outweighs the immediate survival benefits of the other items."
