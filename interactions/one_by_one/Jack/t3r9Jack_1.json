    "explanation": "The ability to signal for help is crucial in your situation, especially when your position is not known and you are far from the nearest settlement. A cosmetic mirror can reflect sunlight to create a highly visible signal that can attract the attention of rescue teams or passing aircraft. In the vast, barren Atacama Desert, effective signaling significantly increases your chances of being found and rescued."
