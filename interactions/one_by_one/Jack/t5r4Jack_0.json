    "item": "Magnetic compass",
    "explanation": "The magnetic compass is the most important item for survival because it will help navigate the vast, featureless terrain of the Atacama Desert and guide you toward the mining camp that is 50 miles away. Without a reliable way to determine direction, you could easily become disoriented and waste precious time and energy. Proper navigation greatly increases your chances of reaching civilization, securing water, and finding rescue."
