    "item": "2 litres of 180 proof liquor",
    "explanation": "The 2 litres of 180 proof liquor is the most important item because it can serve multiple critical purposes for survival. It can be used as a disinfectant for any potential injuries or wounds and as a fire starter due to its high alcohol content, which can help signal for rescue. Staying hydrated is initially vital, and while not ideal, the liquor can also potentially be diluted with any found water sources to purify them."
