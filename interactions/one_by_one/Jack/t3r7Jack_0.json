    "explanation": "The parachute can be used as a large, visible signal for rescue aircraft, significantly increasing the chances of being spotted in the vast desert. It can also provide essential shade from the extreme heat, helping to prevent heatstroke and conserve energy. Additionally, the fabric can be repurposed for other survival needs, such as collecting dew or constructing a simple shelter."
