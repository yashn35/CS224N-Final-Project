    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "In the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert, protection from the sun is critical to avoid heat stroke and severe sunburn. The overcoats can provide much-needed shade and insulation, keeping the body temperature lower. Wearing the overcoats can also help reduce the rate of dehydration by minimizing sweating and shielding the skin from direct exposure to the harsh sunlight."
