    "item": "45 calibre pistol (loaded)",
    "explanation": "The .45 calibre pistol is important for potential defense against wild animals or dangerous situations you might encounter while seeking help. It can also be used to signal rescuers by firing shots into the air, which can be heard over a greater distance compared to yelling or using other means. Survival in this harsh environment requires every means possible to attract attention and ensure safety, making the pistol a better choice over the salt tablets."
