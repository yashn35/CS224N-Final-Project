    "explanation": "The magnetic compass is crucial for navigation, especially in a featureless environment like the Atacama Desert. With a compass, you can maintain a steady direction towards the mining camp located 50 miles away. This significantly increases the chances of reaching help, conserving energy, and avoiding aimless wandering that could lead to dehydration or disorientation."
