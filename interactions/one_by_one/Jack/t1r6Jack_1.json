    "item": "Torch with 4 battery-cells",
    "explanation": "In the harsh environment of the Atacama Desert, having a torch with battery-cells is essential for signaling rescuers during the night when visibility is greater for distant observers. This item also allows for safe navigation and resource gathering during the cooler nighttime hours, thus avoiding the deadly daytime heat. Additionally, the batteries could be utilized for other purposes, such as starting a fire, which is vital for both signaling and warmth."
