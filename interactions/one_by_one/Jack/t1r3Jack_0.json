    "explanation": "A torch with battery-cells is the most important item as it provides light during the night, which helps in navigation and spotting potential hazards. The batteries could also be used to start a fire, which is essential for warmth during freezing desert nights and for signaling rescue teams. Additionally, a steady light source is crucial for any first aid procedures or when moving during twilight to avoid the extreme daytime heat."
