    "explanation": "The first-aid kit is essential for treating any immediate injuries or health issues that may arise from being in a harsh environment like the Atacama Desert. Given the extreme heat and potential for sunburn, dehydration, or other medical problems, having the ability to address these quickly could be life-saving. Additionally, the first-aid kit may contain antiseptics and bandages to prevent infections from any cuts or scrapes, which is crucial in such a desolate area."
