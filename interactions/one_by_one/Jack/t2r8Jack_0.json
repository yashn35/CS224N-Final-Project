    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "In the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert, the overcoats will help protect against sunburn and heat stroke by providing coverage from the direct sun. They can also serve as insulation during the cold desert nights, which can have a significant temperature drop. Conserving body moisture is essential, and the overcoats will help prevent excessive sweating during the day and retain warmth at night."
