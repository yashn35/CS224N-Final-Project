    "explanation": "The 180 proof liquor is essential because it can be used as a disinfectant for potential injuries, which reduces the risk of infection. Additionally, it can be utilized to start a fire by acting as an accelerant, which is important for signaling and warmth during nighttime temperatures. While consuming it directly would dehydrate us, its alcohol content makes it valuable for multiple survival purposes beyond hydration."
