    "explanation": "In the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert, the body will lose a significant amount of salt through sweat, which needs to be replenished to maintain electrolyte balance and prevent heat exhaustion or heat stroke. The salt tablets can help mitigate the risk of dehydration by ensuring that your body retains more water. This becomes crucial for survival in a high-temperature environment where access to water is likely limited."
