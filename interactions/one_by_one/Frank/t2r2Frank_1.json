    "explanation": "The plastic raincoat is critical for survival as it can be used to create a solar still, enabling the production of drinkable water from the limited moisture in the air. In the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert, maintaining hydration is paramount to survival. Additionally, the raincoat offers shade and protection from the sun, helping to prevent heatstroke and further dehydration."
