    "explanation": "The parachute can provide vital shade against the extreme heat, significantly reducing the risk of heatstroke and dehydration. Its bright colors can also be used to signal for help, increasing the chances of being spotted by search and rescue teams. In the barren environment of the Atacama Desert, improving our visibility and protecting ourselves from the sun are critical for survival."
