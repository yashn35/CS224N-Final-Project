    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoat is critically important for survival in the Atacama Desert due to its ability to provide necessary shade from the intense sun, thereby reducing the risk of sunburn, heatstroke, and dehydration. Additionally, the overcoat can offer insulation against the drastic drop in temperatures that can occur during the cold desert nights. This multipurpose utility makes the overcoat the most crucial item for maintaining body temperature and moisture levels, significantly enhancing the likelihood of survival."
