    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "In the Atacama Desert, temperatures can drop drastically at night, making it essential to retain body heat to avoid hypothermia. The overcoat will not only provide much-needed insulation during the cold nights, but it can also offer some protection from the harsh sun during the day. Additionally, it's versatile and can be used to create shade or even as part of a signaling mechanism to attract attention."
