    "item": "45 calibre pistol (loaded)",
    "explanation": "The pistol could be used for signaling for help, as the sound can travel much further than voices. It may also provide a means of defense against potential threats, although unlikely, including wildlife or human. In a survival situation, signaling for help and ensuring safety take precedence."
