    "item": "Plastic raincoat (large size)",
    "explanation": "The plastic raincoat can be used to create a solar still, which is essential for producing drinkable water in the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert. Water is critical to survival, particularly in high temperatures where dehydration can occur rapidly. Additionally, the raincoat can provide shelter and protection from the sun's harsh rays, further helping to prevent heatstroke and dehydration."
