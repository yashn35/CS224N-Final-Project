    "item": "2 litres of 180 proof liquor",
    "explanation": "The 2 litres of 180 proof liquor is the most critical item. It can be used for multiple survival purposes such as disinfecting wounds, starting fires, and its high alcohol content can be diluted and used as a last-resort hydration option in an emergency. In the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert, maintaining health and the ability to start fires for signaling or warmth at night is essential."
