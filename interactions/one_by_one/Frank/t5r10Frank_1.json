    "explanation": "The cosmetic mirror is critical for signaling rescue efforts by reflecting sunlight, which can be seen over long distances in the vast, barren Atacama Desert. Given the extreme temperatures and lack of water, being found quickly is crucial for survival. Additionally, the mirror has the potential to start a fire, which could serve as both a signaling tool and a means to address other survival needs."
