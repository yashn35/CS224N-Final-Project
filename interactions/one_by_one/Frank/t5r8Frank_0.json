    "explanation": "The 2 litres of 180 proof liquor can be used for multiple survival purposes. It can serve as a disinfectant for any potential wounds, and its high alcohol content makes it a valuable fire starter, which is crucial for signaling or warmth during the cold desert nights. While not ideal for hydration, in dire circumstances, it could be consumed in small amounts to stave off dehydration."
