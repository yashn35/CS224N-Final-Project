    "explanation": "The 2 litres of 180 proof liquor can be used to disinfect wounds, which is vital for preventing infections in a survival situation. It can also serve as a fire starter for signaling rescue teams by creating a large, noticeable fire. Lastly, it can be used to conserve any remaining drinking water by mixing small amounts to sterilize it if no other safe water sources are found."
