    "item": "Parachute (red & white)",
    "explanation": "The parachute's vibrant red and white colors can be used as a signaling device to attract potential rescuers from the air, a critical factor given how remote and barren the area is. The ability to signal for help significantly increases your chances of being found quickly in an environment where you are off-course and isolated. Additionally, the material can provide some shade or be used to create a makeshift shelter from the intense heat."
