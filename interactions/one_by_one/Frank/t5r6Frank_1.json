    "explanation": "The parachute provides essential shade to prevent heatstroke and dehydration in the extreme desert heat, making survival during the day possible. Its bright red and white colors significantly increase the chances of being spotted by rescue teams from a distance. Additionally, it can be used to collect moisture at night, providing an invaluable water source in such a barren environment."
