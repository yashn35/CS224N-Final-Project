    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoat is the most important survival item as it provides essential protection against extreme heat during the day and cold at night, reducing the risk of heatstroke and hypothermia. It can be used to create shade, offering a much-needed respite from the sun, and as a barrier against wind and sand. Additionally, it can be employed to collect dew at night, potentially providing a supplementary source of water."
