    "explanation": "The 180 proof liquor can be vital for survival as it can be used as a disinfectant for any potential wounds, reducing the risk of infections. Additionally, the liquor can serve as a makeshift fire starter due to its high alcohol content, which is essential for signaling and warmth during the cold desert nights. While not ideal for hydration, in extreme circumstances, very small amounts could be consumed to help conserve body water by reducing perspiration."
