    "explanation": "The cosmetic mirror is crucial for signaling rescuers by reflecting sunlight, which is vital due to the remote and barren location of the Atacama Desert. Its ability to attract attention from miles away significantly increases the chances of being spotted and rescued. Additionally, it requires no physical exertion to use, preserving energy and hydration which are vital in the extreme heat."
