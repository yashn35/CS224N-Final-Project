    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "Overcoats are essential for providing protection from the intense sun during the day, which reduces the risk of heatstroke and severe sunburn. They can also serve as insulation against the cold desert nights, ensuring that the group stays warm and reduces heat loss. Additionally, overcoats can be used to create shade, collect dew, or signal rescuers, making them highly versatile for survival in the harsh desert environment."
