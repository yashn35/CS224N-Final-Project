    "explanation": "The 2 litres of 180 proof liquor can be used for multiple purposes including sterilization of wounds, as a disinfectant, and as a makeshift fuel for starting a fire, which is crucial for signaling and survival. Furthermore, it can be used to make water potable by killing bacteria if a water source is found. In an environment where temperatures will soar to 130 F, staying sanitized and having the means to signal for rescue could be life-saving."
