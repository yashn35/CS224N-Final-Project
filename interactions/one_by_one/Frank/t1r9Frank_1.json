    "explanation": "The cosmetic mirror can be vital for signaling rescuers in the vast Atacama Desert by reflecting sunlight, increasing the chance of being spotted by aircraft or search parties. Signaling significantly reduces the time it takes for help to find you, which is crucial for survival. Additionally, it can serve as a multifunctional tool for starting fires or seeing around corners."
