    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoat is the most important item because it can provide critical protection from the extreme heat during the day and the cold at night, reducing the risk of heatstroke and hypothermia. In addition, it can be used to create shade, which will help conserve energy and reduce dehydration. Lightweight clothing is insufficient for the harsh desert conditions, making the overcoat a vital survival tool."
