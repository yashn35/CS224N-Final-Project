    "explanation": "In extreme heat, the body loses a significant amount of salt through sweat, which is crucial for maintaining proper hydration and organ function. Although salt tablets need to be taken with water, which might not be immediately available, they can help prevent dehydration and heat stroke when water is consumed. In a desert survival scenario, managing electrolyte balance can be critical to sustaining health and physical capabilities until rescue or reaching a settlement."
