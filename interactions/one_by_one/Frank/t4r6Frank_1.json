    "explanation": "The parachute's vibrant colors can serve as a highly visible signal for rescue teams, which is crucial given the remote and barren landscape. Additionally, the material can be used to create shade, helping to protect against the extreme desert heat and reduce the risk of overheating and dehydration. These dual functionalities significantly increase our chances of being rescued and surviving the harsh conditions."
