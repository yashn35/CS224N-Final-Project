    "item": "Parachute (red & white)",
    "explanation": "The parachute can be used for signaling as its bright colors will be visible from a distance, which increases your chances of being spotted by air search parties or ground rescue teams. It can also provide shade from the extreme heat, potentially preventing heatstroke or sunburn. Finally, the fabric can be used for creating makeshift shelters or for other practical purposes such as collecting dew for drinking water."
