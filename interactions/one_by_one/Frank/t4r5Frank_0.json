    "explanation": "The magnetic compass is crucial for navigation in the barren and flat terrain of the Atacama Desert. It will help ensure we head in the correct direction towards the mining camp indicated by the pilot, reducing the risk of getting lost. Proper navigation is essential for survival, considering we may have to traverse up to 50 miles in extreme temperatures."
