    "explanation": "In the extremely hot and dry conditions of the Atacama Desert, the 2 litres of 180 proof liquor can be used to disinfect wounds and as a fire starter. The high alcohol content makes it a versatile solution for sterilization, which is crucial given the potential for injury in such a harsh environment. Additionally, it can be used to create signals to attract rescuers by burning it, which can be an effective way to communicate your location from a distance."
