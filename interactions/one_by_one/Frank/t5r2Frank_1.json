    "explanation": "The torch with battery cells is essential for visibility and signaling at night, which is crucial in a vast and barren desert like the Atacama. Traveling during the cooler nighttime hours may be necessary to avoid the extreme daytime heat, and the torch will help navigate and avoid potential hazards. Additionally, the light can help attract rescuers' attention, increasing the chance of being found."
