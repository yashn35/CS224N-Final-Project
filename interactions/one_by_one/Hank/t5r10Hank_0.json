    "explanation": "In an extremely hot and barren environment like the Atacama Desert, the cosmetic mirror can be crucial for signaling rescuers. Its reflective surface can catch and direct sunlight over long distances, making it possible to attract attention from search teams or aircraft. Given that you are off-course and no one knows your exact location, being able to signal for help increases your chances of survival significantly."
