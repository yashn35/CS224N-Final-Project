    "item": "Torch with 4 battery-cells",
    "explanation": "The torch with battery cells is the most important item because it provides a reliable light source for signaling rescuers at night or during the cooler evening hours when it is safer to travel. It can also serve to intimidate nocturnal predators and help navigate if you decide to move during the comparatively safer nighttime. Given the vast and flat area, a visible light could drastically improve your chances of being noticed by a search party."
