    "item": "Torch with 4 battery-cells",
    "explanation": "A torch with battery cells is the most important item because it serves multiple critical functions in survival. It can be used for signaling rescuers, illuminating the surroundings during nighttime, and its batteries could potentially be used for other emergency electronic needs. Without a reliable light source, your ability to navigate, find resources, and signal for help would be severely compromised, especially in a desert environment where temperatures drop significantly at night."
