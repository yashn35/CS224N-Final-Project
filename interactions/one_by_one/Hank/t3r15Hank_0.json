    "explanation": "In environments with extreme heat, like the Atacama Desert, the body loses salt rapidly through sweat. Dehydration and salt depletion can lead to heat exhaustion and heat stroke, which are life-threatening conditions. Having salt tablets will help maintain electrolyte balance and reduce the risk of these conditions, aiding survival until rescue."
