    "explanation": "In the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert, preventing dehydration and heat stroke is crucial. The overcoats can be used to provide shade and reduce sun exposure during the hottest parts of the day. Additionally, they can offer some insulation during the cold desert nights, when temperatures can drop significantly, contributing to overall thermal regulation."
