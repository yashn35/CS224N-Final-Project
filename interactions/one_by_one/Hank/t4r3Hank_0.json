    "item": "Plastic raincoat (large size)",
    "explanation": "In the Atacama Desert, protection from the harsh sun is critical due to the high temperatures and strong UV radiation, which could lead to severe sunburn or heatstroke. The plastic raincoat can be used to construct a makeshift shelter to provide much-needed shade and protection from the sun. Additionally, it can help in collecting dew or condensation during the cooler night temperatures, which can be a minor but vital source of water."
