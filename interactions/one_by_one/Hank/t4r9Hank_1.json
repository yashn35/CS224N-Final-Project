    "explanation": "The cosmetic mirror is critical for signaling for help, as its reflective surface can attract the attention of rescue teams or aircraft over long distances in the flat desert terrain. This greatly increases the chances of being located, given the immediate life-threatening conditions. In a scenario where rescue and visibility are paramount due to limited water and extreme temperatures, the ability to signal effectively is essential for survival."
