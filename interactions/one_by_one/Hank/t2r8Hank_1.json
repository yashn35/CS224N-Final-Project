    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoats provide dual protection by shielding you from the intense daytime heat and preventing excessive heat loss during the cold desert nights. This temperature regulation is critical for survival as it helps avoid heatstroke from sun exposure and hypothermia from nighttime temperatures. Additionally, the overcoats can be used to create shade and minimize sun exposure, which is vital to prevent dehydration and related heat illnesses."
