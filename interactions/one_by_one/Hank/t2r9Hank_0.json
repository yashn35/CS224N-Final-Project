    "explanation": "The Atacama Desert has intense sunlight, and prolonged exposure can damage your eyes, leading to vision problems which would hinder your ability to navigate. Protecting your eyes from the harsh sun will help maintain your ability to search for resources and signs of the mining camp. Additionally, sunglasses can prevent headaches and fatigue caused by the glare, which is vital for maintaining your energy and focus in such a harsh environment."
