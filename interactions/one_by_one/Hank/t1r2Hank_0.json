    "item": "2 litres of 180 proof liquor",
    "explanation": "The 2 litres of 180 proof liquor is the most important item because it can serve multiple survival purposes in the Atacama Desert. It can be used as a disinfectant for any potential wounds, a fire starter when combined with available materials, and as a dehydration deterrent by applying it externally to cool the body due to its high evaporation rate. Given the extreme heat, these multi-functional uses can significantly increase our chances of survival and signaling for rescue."
