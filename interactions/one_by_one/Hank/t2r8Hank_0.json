    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoats are the most important because they can provide essential protection from the extreme heat during the day and the cold temperatures at night. They can also be used to create shade and minimize sun exposure, which is critical to prevent dehydration and heatstroke. Additionally, the overcoats can be wrapped around the head and neck as makeshift headwear to further prevent sunburn and heat-related illnesses."
