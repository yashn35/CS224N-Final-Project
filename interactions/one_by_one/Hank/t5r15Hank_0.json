    "explanation": "The bottle of salt tablets is crucial since, in extreme heat, it's easy to become dehydrated and lose essential electrolytes through sweating. Salt tablets can help replace the lost sodium, which is vital for maintaining proper body function and preventing heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion or heat stroke. This is especially important in the harsh desert environment where you will be losing a significant amount of fluids and salts."
