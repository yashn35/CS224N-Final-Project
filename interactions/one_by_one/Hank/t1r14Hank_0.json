    "item": "45 calibre pistol (loaded)",
    "explanation": "The pistol can be used for signaling for help by firing into the air, which could attract attention from any nearby rescue teams. It also serves as a means of protection against potential threats, including wildlife. Given the extreme conditions, self-defense and the ability to signal for rescue outweigh the less immediate need for salt tablets."
