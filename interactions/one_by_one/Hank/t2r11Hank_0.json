    "explanation": "In a survival situation in the desert, staying hydrated is crucial. While 180 proof liquor is not ideal for hydration, it can be used for other essential purposes such as disinfecting wounds or starting a fire for signaling and warmth during the colder desert nights. Additionally, it can be used sparingly with water (if found) to sterilize it before drinking."
