    "item": "Parachute (red & white)",
    "explanation": "The parachute is the most important item because its bright red and white colors can act as a visual signal for rescuers, significantly increasing the chances of being spotted from a distance. Additionally, the parachute can provide essential shade in the extreme desert heat, helping to prevent heatstroke and dehydration. The large fabric can also be used to collect dew or condensation at night, offering a potential supplemental water source."
