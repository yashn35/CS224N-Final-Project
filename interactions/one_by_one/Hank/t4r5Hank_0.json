    "item": "Magnetic compass",
    "explanation": "The magnetic compass is the most important item because it will enable the group to navigate towards the mining camp, which is the nearest known settlement, 50 miles away. Without a means of navigation, the chances of becoming disoriented in the vast, featureless desert and succumbing to the extreme heat are high. Proper navigation will help conserve energy and water, which is critical for survival in such harsh conditions."
