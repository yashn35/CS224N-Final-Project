    "explanation": "In the extreme sunlight and high UV exposure of the Atacama Desert, protecting your eyes is crucial to avoid sun blindness and maintain good vision. With impaired vision, it would be significantly more challenging to navigate towards the mining camp, locate resources, or signal for help. Sunglasses will ensure that everyone's eyes are shielded from the harsh conditions, allowing for better decision-making and increasing our chances of survival."
