    "explanation": "The parachute can be used as a shelter to protect against the extreme heat, providing vital shade during the hot desert day. Additionally, the bright colors will make it easier for any rescue party or aircraft to locate you from a distance. Prioritizing protection from the elements and visibility for rescue significantly increases your chance of survival in the barren Atacama Desert."
