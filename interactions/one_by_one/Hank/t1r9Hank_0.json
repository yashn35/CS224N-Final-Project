    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The most pressing threat is the extreme heat, with ground temperatures reaching up to 130 F. The overcoats can provide necessary protection from the sun and help prevent heatstroke and dehydration by reducing the amount of direct sunlight exposure. Additionally, the overcoats can be used to create shade if necessary, offering further relief from the heat."
