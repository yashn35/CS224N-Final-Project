    "explanation": "The parachute can provide critical shade, which is essential given the extreme temperatures in the Atacama Desert. By creating a shaded area, you reduce the risk of heatstroke and dehydration, preserving your energy for the journey to the mining camp. Additionally, the bright red and white colors can be used to signal for rescue if a search party is dispatched."
