    "explanation": "The plastic raincoat can be used to construct a solar still, which is essential for producing drinking water in the arid environment of the Atacama Desert. Given the extreme temperatures of up to 130 F at ground level, having a method to generate water is crucial for survival. Additionally, the raincoat can be used as a makeshift shelter for shade, helping to prevent heatstroke and conserving body moisture."
