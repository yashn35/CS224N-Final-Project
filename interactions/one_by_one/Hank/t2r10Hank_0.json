    "item": "A cosmetic mirror",
    "explanation": "The cosmetic mirror is the most important item for survival because it can be used to signal for help over long distances by reflecting sunlight. In the vast and barren Atacama Desert, visibility is crucial, and a mirror can be seen from many miles away. This increases your chances of being seen by search parties or passing aircraft, significantly improving your chances of rescue."
