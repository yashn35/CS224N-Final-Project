    "explanation": "In the Atacama Desert, the intense sunlight can cause severe eye damage and impair vision, which are critical for navigating the harsh environment. Protecting our eyes will ensure we maintain clear visibility for spotting potential dangers, resources, and the direction toward the mining camp. Sunglasses will help reduce risks such as sun blindness, which is vital for our overall health and chances of survival."
