    "item": "A cosmetic mirror",
    "explanation": "A cosmetic mirror is the most important item for survival as it can be used to signal for help by reflecting sunlight over long distances. In the vast and barren Atacama Desert, creating visible signals is critical for attracting the attention of rescuers or passing aircraft. This increases the likelihood of being spotted and rescued quickly, which is essential given the harsh conditions of extreme heat and lack of water."
