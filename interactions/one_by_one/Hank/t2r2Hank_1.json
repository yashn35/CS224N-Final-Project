    "explanation": "The plastic raincoat is essential for creating a solar still, which can convert limited moisture into drinkable water, crucial for survival in the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert. Maintaining hydration is critical, and the ability to produce water significantly increases chances of making it to the mining camp or being rescued. Additionally, the raincoat can provide shade and protection from the sun, reducing the risk of heat-related illnesses."
