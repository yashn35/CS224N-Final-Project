    "explanation": "The overcoat will provide crucial protection against the harsh sun and extremely high temperatures, preventing severe sunburn and heatstroke. It can also be used as makeshift shade, offering a cooler space to rest under during breaks in the journey to the mining camp. Additionally, the overcoat may be used to help retain body heat if the temperature drops significantly at night, ensuring survival through the wide temperature variations of the desert."
