    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoat is crucial because it can help protect against the extreme heat by providing shade and reducing sun exposure. In a desert environment, maintaining body temperature and preventing dehydration are critical for survival. The overcoat can also be used to collect dew or moisture during the cooler parts of the day, thus providing a potential water source."
