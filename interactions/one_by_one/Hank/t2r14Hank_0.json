    "item": "45 calibre pistol (loaded)",
    "explanation": "In a desert survival situation, protection from potential threats, such as wildlife or other humans, can be critical. The pistol can also be used to signal for help by firing it into the air, potentially attracting the attention of any planes or people within the distant vicinity. While salt tablets may help with electrolyte balance, they are less critical compared to the immediate survival utility provided by the pistol."
