    "explanation": "The cosmetic mirror is essential for signaling rescue teams by reflecting sunlight, significantly increasing the chances of being spotted in the vastness of the Atacama Desert. The ability to draw attention to your location is crucial for quick rescue, as staying exposed to the harsh desert conditions for extended periods can be life-threatening. Additionally, the mirror can serve as a fire-starting tool, providing heat during cooler nights and helping to signal rescuers even more effectively."
