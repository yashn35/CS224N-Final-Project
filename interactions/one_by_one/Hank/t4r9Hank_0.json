    "explanation": "The cosmetic mirror can be used to signal for help by reflecting sunlight, which can be seen over long distances in the flat, barren landscape of the Atacama Desert. This increases the chances of being spotted by aircraft or other travelers in the area who might be searching for you. Signaling for help is crucial since you are far from your flight path and the extreme temperature poses a severe risk to your survival."
