    "item": "45 calibre pistol (loaded)",
    "explanation": "The 45 calibre pistol can be used for both signaling and self-defense, which can be crucial for survival. It can create loud noises which might attract rescue parties or help deter potential threats like wild animals. While salt tablets can prevent dehydration, finding a water source is paramount, and the pistol's utility in protection and signaling outweighs that of the salt tablets."
