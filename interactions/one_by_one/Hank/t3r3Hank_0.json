    "item": "2 litres of 180 proof liquor",
    "explanation": "Staying hydrated is critical in the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert, and while liquor is not ideal, it can be used as a temporary measure to maintain hydration until a better source is found. Furthermore, it can be used to sterilize wounds, which is essential given the limited medical supplies. Additionally, the high proof liquor can potentially be used to start a fire for signaling or warmth at night."
