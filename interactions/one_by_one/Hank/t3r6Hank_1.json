    "explanation": "The torch with battery-cells is vital for both navigation and signaling for rescuers at night, when temperatures are more bearable for travel. Its light is a powerful distress signal, considerably improving the chances of being found by rescuers scanning the area. Additionally, it can help avoid hazards and nocturnal predators, providing psychological comfort and maintaining group morale throughout the dark hours."
