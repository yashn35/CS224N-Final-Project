    "explanation": "The overcoats are crucial as they can help protect everyone against the extreme heat and sun exposure, reducing the risk of heatstroke and severe sunburn. They can be used as makeshift shelters or barriers against the wind and sand. Additionally, during the cooler desert nights, the overcoats can provide necessary warmth."
