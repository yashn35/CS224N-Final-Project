    "explanation": "Survival in the harsh environment of the Atacama Desert will depend largely on our ability to find food and water. This book can guide us in identifying edible sources in an otherwise barren landscape, which is crucial for our long-term survival. Knowledge of desert animals can also lead us to sources of water as many animals in such environments live near scarce water sources."
