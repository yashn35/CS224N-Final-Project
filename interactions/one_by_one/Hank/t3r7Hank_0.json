    "explanation": "The parachute can be used to provide shade, which is crucial to prevent heat stroke and dehydration in the Atacama Desert's extreme temperatures. Its visible colors can also serve as a signaling device to make you more noticeable to potential rescue parties. Providing cover from the intense sun will help manage the risks of sunburn and overheating, increasing your chances of survival until rescue arrives."
