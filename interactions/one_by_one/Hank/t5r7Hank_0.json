    "explanation": "The parachute can be used as a signal to attract rescuers, which is crucial since no one knows your exact location. Its bright colors can be easily spotted from a distance. Additionally, it can provide some protection from the harsh sun and extreme heat by creating shade during the hottest parts of the day, preventing heatstroke and dehydration."
