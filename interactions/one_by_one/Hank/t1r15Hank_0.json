    "explanation": "In the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert, your body will lose a significant amount of salt through sweat, which can lead to deadly hyponatremia if not replenished. Replenishing salt is critical to maintaining proper hydration and bodily functions, especially when drinking limited water sources. Salt tablets can help maintain electrolyte balance and reduce the risk of heat-related illnesses."
