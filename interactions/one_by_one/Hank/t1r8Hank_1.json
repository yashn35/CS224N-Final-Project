    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "In the extreme temperatures of the Atacama Desert, overcoats provide essential protection from the intense sunlight and heat during the day. This helps prevent heatstroke and severe sunburn, which are critical for survival in such an environment. Additionally, overcoats provide insulation during the colder desert nights, aiding in maintaining a consistent body temperature and reducing the risk of hypothermia."
