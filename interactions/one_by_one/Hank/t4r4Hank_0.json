    "item": "Torch with 4 battery-cells",
    "explanation": "Given the extreme heat and the distance to the nearest settlement, the torch will be essential for signaling for help, especially during the cooler nighttime when search efforts are more likely. The batteries will ensure that the light is sustained for a longer duration, increasing the chances of being spotted. Moreover, the torch can help in navigating during the night if survival requires travel under cooler conditions."
