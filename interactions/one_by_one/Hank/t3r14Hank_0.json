    "item": "45 calibre pistol (loaded)",
    "explanation": "The pistol can be used for signaling purposes by firing shots to attract rescue teams or nearby miners. It can also serve as a means of protection against any potential threats in the desert. While salt tablets may help with electrolyte balance, access to water is more critical, and the pistol has a more immediate and versatile range of uses."
