    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoat is the most important item because it offers critical protection from both the extreme heat during the day and the cold temperatures at night. Without adequate sun protection, there is a high risk of heatstroke, and the overcoats can provide insulation against temperature drops when the sun sets. Ensuring protection from these temperature extremes is vital for survival until rescue."
