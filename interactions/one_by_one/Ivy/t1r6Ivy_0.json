    "item": "Parachute (red & white)",
    "explanation": "The parachute can provide critical protection from the extreme heat by creating shade, which is crucial in temperatures that can reach up to 130 F. It can also serve as a large, visible signal for potential rescuers flying overhead, increasing the chances of being found. Additionally, its durable fabric can be used for other survival needs, such as making a shelter or collecting water."
