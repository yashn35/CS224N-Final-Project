    "item": "Magnetic compass",
    "explanation": "The magnetic compass is the most important remaining item because it enables precise navigation to the nearest settlement, the mining camp, which is 50 miles away. In the vast and featureless Atacama Desert, getting disoriented would be easy and could be fatal due to the extreme heat and dehydration risk. Accurate navigation toward the mining camp increases our chances of reaching safety and survival significantly."
