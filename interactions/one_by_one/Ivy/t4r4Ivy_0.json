    "explanation": "In the extremely high temperatures of the Atacama Desert, the ability to signal for help during the cooler nighttime is crucial, making a torch with batteries exceptionally valuable. It can serve both to create light and potentially signal rescuers over a long distance. Additionally, it may help identify the direction and signs of life if you decide to move at night to avoid the scorching daytime heat."
