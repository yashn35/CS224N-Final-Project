    "item": "A cosmetic mirror",
    "explanation": "The cosmetic mirror is the most important item because it can be used to signal for help by reflecting sunlight, which is vital in a vast and remote area like the Atacama Desert. Increased visibility significantly enhances the chances of being spotted by rescuers both on the ground and from the air. Additionally, signaling requires minimal physical effort, conserving our energy and hydration in the extreme heat."
