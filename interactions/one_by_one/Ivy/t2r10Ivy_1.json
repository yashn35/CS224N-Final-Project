    "explanation": "A cosmetic mirror is essential because it can be used to signal for help by reflecting sunlight. In the vast and barren Atacama Desert, creating visible signals is crucial for attracting the attention of rescuers and passing aircraft. This signaling capability significantly increases the chances of being found, which is vital in the extreme and harsh conditions of the desert."
