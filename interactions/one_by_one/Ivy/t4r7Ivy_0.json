    "explanation": "The parachute can serve multiple critical purposes. Its bright colors can be used as a signaling device to attract rescue teams, which is crucial since your location is not known and the area is vast. Additionally, the parachute fabric can provide essential shade from the intense sun, helping to prevent heatstroke and extend the survival time of the group."
