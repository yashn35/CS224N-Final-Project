    "explanation": "The torch with battery-cells is the most important item as it can be used for signaling rescuers during both day and night. Having a reliable light source can help in finding safety or any nearby resources and ensuring the group stays on the right path if they decide to move. Additionally, it can serve as a means of communication and alerting nearby settlements or search parties of your presence."
