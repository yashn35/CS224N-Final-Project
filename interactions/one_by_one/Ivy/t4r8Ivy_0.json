    "explanation": "The harsh sunlight and high temperatures in the Atacama Desert can cause severe vision impairment and dehydration due to constant squinting. By protecting everyone's eyes with sunglasses, you can significantly reduce the risk of sunburned eyes and maintain visibility, which is crucial for navigation. This will help conserve energy and ensure that the group can travel without additional strain."
