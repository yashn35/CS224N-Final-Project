    "explanation": "The body will need water to survive, and the high-proof liquor can be used to disinfect wounds if necessary, which is vital given the harsh conditions. Additionally, it can be diluted to lower its alcohol content and make it slightly safer to consume in small amounts until a better water source is found. Preventing dehydration is paramount in the extreme desert heat."
