    "explanation": "The air map of the area is crucial because it provides essential information for navigation, ensuring we take the correct path to the mining camp, 50 miles away. Accurate navigation is vital in the vast, featureless expanse of the Atacama Desert, where getting lost could lead to fatal dehydration. This map, combined with our knowledge of being 65 miles off course, gives us the best chance to find help and survive."
