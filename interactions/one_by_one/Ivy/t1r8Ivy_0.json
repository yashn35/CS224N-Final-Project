    "explanation": "In the intense heat and glare of the Atacama Desert, protecting your eyes is crucial to maintain your ability to see and navigate. The blinding sunlight and UV exposure can cause eye damage, leading to temporary blindness, which would be catastrophic in such an environment. Sunglasses will help prevent this, ensuring that everyone can still move efficiently and stay oriented towards finding help or shelter."
