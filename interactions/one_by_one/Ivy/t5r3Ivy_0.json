    "explanation": "The most critical survival necessity in the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert is ensuring hydration to prevent rapid dehydration. The 2 litres of 180 proof liquor, when diluted, can be used as a disinfectant for any potential injuries and, more importantly, provide a method to sterilize any water you may find. Additionally, the high alcohol content can be used to light a signal fire to increase the chances of being spotted by rescuers."
