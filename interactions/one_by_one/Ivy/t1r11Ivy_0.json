    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoat is the most important item because it will provide essential protection against the extreme heat and sun during the day. With temperatures potentially reaching 130 F at ground level, shielding ourselves from direct sunlight could prevent heatstroke and dehydration. The overcoats can also be used at night when the temperature drops, helping to conserve body heat and avoid hypothermia."
