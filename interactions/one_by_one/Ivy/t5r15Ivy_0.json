    "explanation": "Salt tablets help prevent dehydration by retaining fluids in the body, which is critical in an extremely hot environment like the Atacama Desert. With the expected temperatures reaching 130 F, maintaining hydration and electrolyte levels is essential to avoid heat-related illnesses. While other items might have some utility, the salt tablets directly address a fundamental survival need in the harsh, dry heat."
