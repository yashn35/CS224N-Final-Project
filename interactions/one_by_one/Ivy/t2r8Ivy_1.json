    "explanation": "The overcoats are essential as they provide both daytime protection from the intense sun and nighttime insulation when temperatures drop significantly, helping to regulate body temperature. They can also be used to create shade, which is critical for staying cool and preventing heat-related illnesses like heatstroke. Additionally, the large fabric pieces can be utilized for multiple survival purposes, such as signaling for rescue and collecting dew for water."
