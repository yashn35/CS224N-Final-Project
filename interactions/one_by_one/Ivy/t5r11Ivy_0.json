    "item": "2 litres of 180 proof liquor",
    "explanation": "The 2 litres of 180 proof liquor is the most important item because it can be used for multiple critical survival purposes. It can serve as a disinfectant for any potential wounds, reducing the risk of infection in this harsh environment. Additionally, it can be used sparingly to help retain body heat during the extreme temperature drops at night, and in small, diluted amounts, it can provide an emergency source of hydration if no other water source is available."
