    "explanation": "Given the extreme heat and distance to the nearest settlement, having a reliable means of navigation is critical to ensure we head in the right direction and do not waste energy or water. The magnetic compass will help us maintain a straight course towards the mining camp, greatly increasing our chances of survival. Without it, we risk wandering aimlessly in the barren desert, which would be a death sentence in this environment."
