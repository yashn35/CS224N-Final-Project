    "explanation": "In the vast and barren Atacama Desert, navigation is crucial for finding the mining camp, which is the nearest known settlement and our best chance for rescue. With no distinguishable landmarks and the intense heat, the magnetic compass will help us maintain a consistent direction towards safety. This tool will prevent us from walking in circles and will significantly increase our chances of survival."
