    "explanation": "Given the extreme heat of 130 F at ground level, dehydration is a critical concern, and it can be exacerbated by the loss of essential electrolytes like sodium through sweat. Salt tablets can help replace the lost sodium, maintaining electrolyte balance and preventing conditions like hyponatremia, which can be life-threatening. Despite the absence of other resources, the ability to maintain electrolyte balance is crucial for both physical and cognitive function during an emergency situation."
