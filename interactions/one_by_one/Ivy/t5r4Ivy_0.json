    "item": "Torch with 4 battery-cells",
    "explanation": "The torch with 4 battery-cells is the most important item because it provides both light and a signaling means for rescue. In the vast and barren Atacama Desert, the ability to signal rescuers at night can be a crucial difference between life and death. Additionally, if the batteries are powerful enough, they might also be used to start a fire for warmth or further signaling."
