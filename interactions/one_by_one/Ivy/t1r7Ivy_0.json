    "item": "Parachute (red & white)",
    "explanation": "The parachute is the most important item because its bright red and white fabric can be used to signal for help, increasing the chances of being spotted by rescue teams or passing aircraft. In such extreme temperatures, being rescued quickly is critical for survival. Additionally, the fabric can provide some shade, helping to protect against the harsh sun and reduce the risk of heatstroke."
