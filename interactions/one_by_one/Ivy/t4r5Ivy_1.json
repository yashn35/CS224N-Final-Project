    "explanation": "The magnetic compass is crucial for navigating towards the mining camp, which is our best chance of finding food, water, and shelter. Without proper navigation, we risk getting lost in the vast, barren landscape of the Atacama Desert, which could be fatal given the extreme heat and lack of resources. Using a compass ensures we maintain the correct direction and increase our chances of survival significantly."
