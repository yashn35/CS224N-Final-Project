    "explanation": "The Atacama Desert is known for its extreme sunlight and high temperatures, which can lead to severe eye strain and potential damage without proper protection. Sunglasses will help prevent vision impairment and allow us to navigate better throughout the day. Preserving our vision is crucial for both immediate survival and while trying to locate the mining camp, which is 50 miles away."
