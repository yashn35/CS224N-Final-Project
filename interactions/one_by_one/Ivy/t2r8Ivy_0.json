    "explanation": "Given the extreme heat and the high sun exposure in the Atacama Desert, protecting your eyes from the harmful UV rays is crucial for maintaining clear vision. Sunglasses can help prevent vision impairment and reduce the risk of sun-related issues such as headaches or even temporary blindness, which could hinder your ability to navigate and find rescue. Clear vision is essential for survival, as it allows you to effectively use the other resources and identify potential dangers or landmarks."
