    "item": "Bottle of 1000 salt tablets",
    "explanation": "Although salt tablets can help with electrolyte replacement, they can be harmful without an adequate water supply, which is critical in extreme heat conditions. It is essential to prioritize hydration over other concerns in such an environment. Given that we do not have access to water, the salt tablets are not the most practical item, but they hold the most potential for use if we manage to find water."
