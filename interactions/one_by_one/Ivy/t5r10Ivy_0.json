    "explanation": "The 180 proof liquor can be used for multiple purposes, such as sterilizing any wounds to prevent infection. It can also be used as a fire starter, which is crucial for signaling for help in the vast, barren desert. Furthermore, it can be consumed in very small amounts for temporary relief from the stress and harsh conditions, although this should be done cautiously."
