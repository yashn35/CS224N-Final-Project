    "explanation": "In the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert, maintaining proper hydration is critical to survival. Given the conditions, sweating will lead to a significant loss of salt, which is essential for maintaining electrolyte balance and avoiding dehydration. The salt tablets will help replace the lost sodium and improve our chances of surviving until rescue or finding the mining camp."
