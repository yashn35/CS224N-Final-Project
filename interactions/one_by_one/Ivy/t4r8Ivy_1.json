    "explanation": "In the intense Atacama Desert, maintaining the ability to see clearly is crucial for navigation and for spotting potential hazards or landmarks. Sunglasses will protect everyone's eyes from the strong UV rays and the glare of the sun, reducing the risk of debilitating eye damage. This protection helps ensure that the group can travel safely and effectively towards the mining camp, increasing their chances of survival."
