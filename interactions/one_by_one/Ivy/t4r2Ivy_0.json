    "explanation": "The plastic raincoat can be crucial for survival in the desert. It can be used to create a makeshift shelter to provide shade from the intense sun, reducing the risk of heatstroke. Additionally, it can help in collecting condensation and dew during the cooler parts of the day, providing a small source of water in this arid environment."
