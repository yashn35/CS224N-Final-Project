    "explanation": "The torch with battery-cells is crucial for signaling rescuers, particularly at night or in low visibility conditions. Its light can help attract attention and ensure that the group is more easily spotted. Additionally, having a reliable source of light will aid in navigating safely after sunset when temperatures are lower, reducing the risk of heat-related issues during the day."
