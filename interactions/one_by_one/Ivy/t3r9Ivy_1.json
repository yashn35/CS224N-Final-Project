    "explanation": "The cosmetic mirror is essential because it can be used to signal for help over long distances by reflecting sunlight, increasing the likelihood of being spotted by rescuers or passing aircraft in the vast, barren desert. Given that our position is not known and we are far from any settlement, efficient signaling is key to survival. This significantly enhances our chances of being rescued quickly in the extreme temperatures of the Atacama Desert."
