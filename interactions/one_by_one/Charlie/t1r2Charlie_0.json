    "explanation": "In a flat and barren landscape like the Atacama Desert, a torch can be vital for signaling rescue teams, especially during the night when visibility is poor. The combination of a consistent light source and the ability to create visible signals from afar increases the chances of being found. Additionally, it can be used for potential navigation and emergency situations during the night."
