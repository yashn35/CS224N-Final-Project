    "explanation": "Food is a critical resource for survival, and this book can guide us on what local wildlife is safe to eat. In the barren Atacama Desert, knowing how to find and prepare edible animals could sustain us until help arrives. Additionally, the knowledge could be leveraged to plan a trek towards the mining camp if necessary."
