    "explanation": "In the intense heat of the Atacama Desert, our bodies will sweat excessively, leading to a rapid loss of essential salts and electrolytes. The salt tablets will help replenish these lost minerals and prevent dehydration and heat exhaustion. Without them, our risk of severe heat-related illnesses will significantly increase, making it harder to survive until rescue or reaching the mining camp."
