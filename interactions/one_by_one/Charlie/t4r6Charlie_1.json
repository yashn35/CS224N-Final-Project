    "explanation": "The parachute's bright colors make it highly visible, making it an invaluable tool for signaling rescue teams in the vast and barren desert. It can also provide shade, reducing the risk of heatstroke and dehydration because temperatures can reach up to 130 F at ground level. Additionally, the material can be used to create makeshift shelter, ensuring protection from extreme conditions while waiting for rescue."
