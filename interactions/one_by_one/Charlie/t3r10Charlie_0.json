    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "In the blistering heat of the Atacama Desert, protecting ourselves from sun exposure is critical to avoid severe sunburn and heatstroke. By wearing the overcoats, we can create shade and reduce the risk of dehydration caused by excessive perspiration. Additionally, the overcoats can be used as makeshift shelters during the hottest part of the day, enhancing our chances of survival until we find help."
