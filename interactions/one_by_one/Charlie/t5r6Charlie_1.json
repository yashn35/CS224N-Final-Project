    "explanation": "The parachute serves as a crucial signaling device with its bright colors, significantly improving the chances of being spotted by rescue teams from a distance. It can also provide much-needed shade from the intense desert heat, helping to prevent heatstroke and dehydration. Additionally, it can be used to collect morning dew or moisture, offering a potential water source in an extremely arid environment."
