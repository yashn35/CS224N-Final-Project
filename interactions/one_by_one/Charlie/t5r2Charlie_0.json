    "explanation": "In the vast and barren Atacama Desert, nighttime vision and signaling are essential for navigation and potential rescue. The torch can help us see in the dark, avoid dangerous obstacles, and signal for help to any distant search parties. Given the extreme heat and potential necessity to travel during the cooler nighttime, the torch is invaluable for ensuring our group's safety and survival."
