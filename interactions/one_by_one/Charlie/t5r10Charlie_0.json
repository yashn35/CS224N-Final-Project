    "item": "A cosmetic mirror",
    "explanation": "The cosmetic mirror is the most important item because it can be used for signaling passing aircraft or search parties, dramatically increasing the chances of rescue.

Additionally, the mirror can also be used to reflect sunlight and potentially start a fire if needed."
