    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoat can protect against the intense heat of the Atacama Desert by providing necessary shade from the sun, reducing the risk of sunburn and overheating. It will also help conserve body moisture by minimizing direct exposure to the sun, crucial for preventing dehydration. Additionally, the overcoat can serve as insulation during the cold desert nights, which can drop to dramatically lower temperatures."
