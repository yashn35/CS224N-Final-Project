    "explanation": "The Atacama Desert's intense sunlight and UV radiation pose a serious threat to our vision, leading to possible temporary or permanent eye damage. Protecting our eyes will ensure that we can effectively navigate, spot resources, and avoid hazards during the trek to the mining camp. Sunglasses are crucial for preventing vision impairment, thereby maintaining our ability to move efficiently and survive in the desert environment."
