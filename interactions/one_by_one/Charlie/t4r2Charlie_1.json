    "explanation": "In the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert, securing a consistent source of water is critical for survival. The plastic raincoat can be used to create a solar still, which can produce drinkable water from condensation, thus addressing the immediate threat of dehydration. Additionally, it can provide some protection from the harsh sun, reducing the risk of heatstroke and sunburn, and thereby maintaining our physical condition for the arduous journey ahead."
