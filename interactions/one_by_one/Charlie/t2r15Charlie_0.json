    "explanation": "In extreme heat and with significant physical effort, your body will lose a lot of sodium through sweat, leading to dehydration and heat stroke. Salt tablets can help maintain the balance of electrolytes, which are crucial for your muscles and nervous system to function properly. While not a replacement for water, they can help delay the onset of severe dehydration until rescue or additional water sources are found."
