    "item": "45 calibre pistol (loaded)",
    "explanation": "The pistol could be crucial for signaling rescuers or defending against potential threats. While the salt tablets might help with electrolyte balance, hydration is a more pressing concern in extreme heat. Thus, the ability to attract attention and increase our chances of rescue outweighs the need for salt intake."
