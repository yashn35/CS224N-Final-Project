    "explanation": "The parachute can be used as a large, visible signal to attract rescuers, which is crucial since your exact location is unknown. Additionally, it can provide shade to protect the group from the extreme heat, helping prevent dehydration and heatstroke. In a barren desert environment, visibility and protection from the sun are key to survival until rescue."
