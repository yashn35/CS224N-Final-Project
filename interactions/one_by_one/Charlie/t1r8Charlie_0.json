    "explanation": "The Atacama Desert is one of the driest places on Earth with intense sunlight. Protecting our eyes from sun glare and UV radiation is crucial to avoid temporary or permanent eye damage, which can severely impede our ability to navigate and survive. Additionally, sunglasses will help preserve our vision, allowing us to efficiently search for resources and a route to the mining camp."
