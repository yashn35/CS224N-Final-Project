    "explanation": "The torch with battery-cells is crucial for signaling and navigating during the night or in low-visibility conditions, which can significantly improve chances of rescue and survival. The Atacama Desert has extreme temperature variations, and being able to move safely at night when it is cooler will conserve energy and hydration. Additionally, the light can be used to start fires or signal rescuers, making it a multi-functional tool."
