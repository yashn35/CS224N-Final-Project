    "item": "2 litres of 180 proof liquor",
    "explanation": "The 180 proof liquor can serve multiple crucial purposes. First, it can be used as a disinfectant for any potential wounds to prevent infection in a harsh desert environment. Second, it can be a valuable fire-starting aid if you need to signal for help or build a fire for warmth during the cold desert nights. Lastly, in extreme desperation, it can be consumed in very small quantities to avoid dehydration, although this is highly discouraged."
