    "explanation": "A torch can be crucial for signaling rescue teams, particularly at night when visibility is low. Its batteries can also serve as a makeshift power source for other potential needs, such as igniting a fire or operating electrical equipment. The torch's light can assist in navigating the desert terrain if travel is necessary during cooler night hours, reducing the risk of getting lost."
