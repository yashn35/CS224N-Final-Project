    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoats are the most crucial items because they can provide necessary protection from the intense sun and high temperatures, reducing the risk of heatstroke and severe sunburn. They can also help conserve body moisture, which is critical in preventing dehydration. Furthermore, overcoats can be used as shade shelters during breaks or even to cover wounds, should any injuries occur during the trek to the mining camp."
