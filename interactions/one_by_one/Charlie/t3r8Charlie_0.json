    "item": "A cosmetic mirror",
    "explanation": "The cosmetic mirror is the most important item because it can be used to signal for help, increasing your chances of being rescued. Reflecting sunlight with a mirror can be seen from great distances, even from airplanes. While other items might help with survival in the interim, the primary goal is to get noticed and rescued as soon as possible in such a hostile environment."
