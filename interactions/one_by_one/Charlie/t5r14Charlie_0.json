    "explanation": "Survival in a hostile environment like the Atacama Desert may require defense against potential threats, such as wild animals or hostile humans. Additionally, the pistol can be used to signal for help by firing into the air, which could draw attention to your location. A pistol can also be used to deter or hunt wildlife if absolutely necessary for survival."
