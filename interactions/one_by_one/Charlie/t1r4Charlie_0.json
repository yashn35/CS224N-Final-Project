    "explanation": "The torch will be crucial for signaling during the nighttime when temperatures drop, increasing the chances of being spotted by any rescuers. Additionally, it can provide light for safe movement and identifying potential hazards or edible materials in the dark, including the 'Desert Animals That Can Be Eaten' mentioned in the book. Battery cells can also be used in multiple ways, possibly to start a fire, which could be vital for warmth and further signaling."
