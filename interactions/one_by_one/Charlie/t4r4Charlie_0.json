    "item": "2 litres of 180 proof liquor",
    "explanation": "The extreme temperatures in the Atacama Desert will dehydrate us very quickly; therefore, having a liquid source is crucial for survival. Although not an ideal hydration solution, the 180 proof liquor can be diluted to provide some liquid intake until we find a better water source. Additionally, the high alcohol content can be used as an antiseptic in case of injuries or for starting fires at night for warmth or signaling."
