    "explanation": "The magnetic compass will be critical for navigation, ensuring we head directly towards the mining camp, which is over 50 miles away and our best chance for rescue. In the featureless and extreme environment of the Atacama Desert, maintaining a consistent direction is essential to avoid dehydration and excessive exposure to the harsh conditions. Without a reliable tool for navigation, we risk wandering aimlessly and depleting our limited resources, drastically reducing our chances of survival."
