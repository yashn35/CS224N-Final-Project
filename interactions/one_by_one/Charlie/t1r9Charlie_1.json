    "explanation": "The cosmetic mirror is the most important because it allows for effective signaling to attract the attention of any possible rescuers. With the flat and barren environment of the Atacama Desert, being able to reflect sunlight can significantly increase the likelihood of being seen from afar. Rescue and visibility are crucial in such a remote and inhospitable area, and signaling can drastically cut down the time for search teams to find you."
