    "explanation": "The torch with batteries can be used for signaling rescuers at night or attracting attention during the day by flashing light intermittently. Given the extreme temperatures and barrenness of the Atacama Desert, standing out visually is crucial for increasing our chances of being discovered. Additionally, the torch can help us navigate safely if we decide to walk during the cooler nighttime hours."
