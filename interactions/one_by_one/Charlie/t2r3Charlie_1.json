    "explanation": "In the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert, it is crucial to mitigate the risk of dehydration and heat stroke. The plastic raincoat can be used to create a makeshift shelter for shade or as a tool to collect condensation or dew, which provides a vital source of water. Furthermore, the raincoat can also perform other functions such as signaling for rescue with its reflective surface."
