    "explanation": "The torch with battery-cells is critical for signaling and navigation, especially if we need to move during the cooler night hours to avoid the extreme daytime heat. The light can be used to attract the attention of rescuers or safely navigate through the desert. It also provides a significant psychological boost in a stressful survival situation."
