    "explanation": "The overcoats can provide crucial protection against the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert. By covering ourselves, we can reduce the risk of heatstroke and sunburn, which are major threats in this environment. Moreover, the overcoats can be used to collect dew or moisture during the cooler nights, which can be essential for hydration."
