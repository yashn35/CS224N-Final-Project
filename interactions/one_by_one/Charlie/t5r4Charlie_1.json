    "explanation": "The magnetic compass is the most important item as it ensures accurate navigation towards the mining camp, which is our closest chance for rescue. In the featureless Atacama Desert, it is easy to become disoriented without a reliable means to determine direction. Accurate navigation not only conserves energy but also significantly increases our chances of survival by ensuring we reach safety before succumbing to the extreme temperatures and lack of resources."
