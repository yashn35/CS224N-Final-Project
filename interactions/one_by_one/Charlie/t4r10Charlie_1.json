    "item": "A cosmetic mirror",
    "explanation": "The cosmetic mirror is the most important item because it can be used to signal for help by reflecting sunlight. In the vast, barren Atacama Desert, being able to attract attention from rescuers or passing aircraft is crucial for increasing our chances of being found. Given the high visibility due to the clear skies, a reflective signal can be seen from miles away, significantly improving our likelihood of rescue."
