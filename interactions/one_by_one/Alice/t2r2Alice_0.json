    "item": "Plastic raincoat (large size)",
    "explanation": "The plastic raincoat is crucial for survival because it can be used to create a solar still, which will allow us to convert the moisture in the air into drinkable water, essential in the harsh desert environment. Additionally, it can provide shade and protection from the extreme heat, helping prevent heatstroke. The ability to secure even small amounts of water vastly increases our chances of making it to the mining camp or being rescued."
