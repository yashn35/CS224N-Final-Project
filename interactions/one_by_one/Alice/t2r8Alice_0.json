    "explanation": "In the extreme heat and intense sunlight of the Atacama Desert, protecting our eyes is crucial to prevent sun glare and possible eye damage, which can greatly impair vision and mobility. Sunglasses will help maintain clear vision, reducing the risk of sun blindness and making it easier to navigate the barren landscape. Additionally, preserving our sense of sight is essential for spotting potential water sources, shelters, or signaling opportunities."
