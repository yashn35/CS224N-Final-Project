    "item": "Magnetic compass",
    "explanation": "The magnetic compass is the most important item as it ensures we can maintain a direct route towards the mining camp 50 miles away, which is critical for finding help efficiently. Accurate navigation prevents us from getting disoriented in the featureless desert, conserving our limited water supply and reducing the risk of exhaustion and heat stroke. By keeping our direction straight, we greatly increase our chances of survival in the extreme conditions of the Atacama Desert."
