    "explanation": "In the intensely bright and UV-heavy environment of the Atacama Desert, protecting your eyes is paramount to avoid sun blindness and severe eye strain. Sunglasses will help maintain clear vision, which is crucial for navigation and spotting potential sources of rescue. Without proper eye protection, even basic survival tasks could become exceedingly difficult, reducing our chances of reaching the mining camp or being rescued."
