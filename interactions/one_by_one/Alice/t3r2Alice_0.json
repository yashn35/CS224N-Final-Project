    "explanation": "In the Atacama Desert, temperatures can become dangerously high during the day. A plastic raincoat can be used to create a solar still to extract drinking water from the air, which is critical for survival in such an arid environment. Additionally, it can provide necessary shade or be used to collect dew during colder nighttime temperatures."
