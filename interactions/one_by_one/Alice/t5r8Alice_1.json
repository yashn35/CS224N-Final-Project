    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoats are essential for providing shade from the intense heat of the Atacama Desert, reducing the risk of sunburn and heatstroke. They also help conserve body moisture by minimizing direct sun exposure. In addition, overcoats can offer insulation during the cold desert nights, ensuring a stable body temperature in the fluctuating desert climate."
