    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "In the harsh environment of the Atacama Desert, handling extreme temperature variations is crucial. During the day, overcoats can provide protection from the sun, decreasing the risk of heatstroke and sunburns. At night, when temperatures drop significantly, these overcoats will help prevent hypothermia by providing necessary warmth."
