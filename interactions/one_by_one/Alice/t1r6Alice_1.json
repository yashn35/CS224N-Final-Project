    "explanation": "The parachute is crucial for survival because it can be used to create shade, which is essential in preventing heatstroke and severe dehydration in the extreme temperatures of the Atacama Desert. Its vibrant colors make it an effective signaling device that can be seen from a distance, increasing the chances of being rescued. Additionally, the fabric can be repurposed for various survival needs, such as constructing a shelter or collecting water, which are vital for sustaining life until rescue."
