    "explanation": "The Atacama Desert is one of the driest places on Earth and the sun's rays can cause severe damage to your eyes. Sunglasses will protect your eyes from the intense UV rays, which is essential for the long trek to the mining camp. Without proper eye protection, the risk of vision impairment or even blindness increases, severely hampering your ability to navigate and survive in the harsh desert environment."
