    "explanation": "The 45 calibre pistol can be used for signaling for help or deterring potential threats, both human and animal. In a survival situation, having a means to signal rescuers or defend oneself is crucial for maintaining safety. While salt tablets can be important for maintaining electrolyte balance, the immediate concerns of signaling for rescue and protection are more pressing."
