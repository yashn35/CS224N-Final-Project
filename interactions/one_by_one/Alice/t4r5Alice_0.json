    "item": "Magnetic compass",
    "explanation": "The magnetic compass is the most important item because it will allow us to navigate and maintain a consistent direction towards the mining camp, which is 50 miles away. In a barren desert like the Atacama, landmarks are scarce, and without a compass, we could easily lose our way, increasing the risk of dehydration and exposure. Knowing our heading will be crucial to efficiently reaching safety and increasing our chances of survival."
