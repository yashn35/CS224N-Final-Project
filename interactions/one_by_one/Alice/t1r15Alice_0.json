    "explanation": "The Bottle of 1000 salt tablets is the most important item because, in extreme heat, you will lose a significant amount of electrolytes through sweat. Maintaining electrolyte balance is crucial to prevent dehydration and heat-related illnesses. Although water is essential, having salt tablets helps to retain and effectively utilize any water you may find or have, reducing the risk of heat exhaustion or heat stroke."
