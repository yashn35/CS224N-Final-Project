    "explanation": "The brightly colored parachute can serve as an essential signal for rescuers, making it more likely they will spot you. Additionally, it can provide much-needed shade from the extreme desert heat, preventing heat stroke and sunburn. Its fabric can also be used to collect dew in the mornings, providing a small but crucial source of water."
