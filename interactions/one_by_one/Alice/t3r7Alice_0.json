    "item": "Parachute (red & white)",
    "explanation": "The red and white parachute is the most important item because it can provide much-needed shade from the extreme heat, significantly reducing the risk of heatstroke. Its bright colors also make it an excellent signal for rescuers, increasing the chances of being spotted from a distance. Survival in the desert requires both protection from the sun and visibility for rescue efforts."
