    "explanation": "The magnetic compass is the most crucial item for survival as it will enable us to navigate accurately towards the mining camp, which is the nearest known settlement, 50 miles away. In the vast, featureless expanse of the Atacama Desert, it's easy to become disoriented. The compass will help ensure we move in the right direction, increasing our chances of finding help and surviving the harsh conditions."
