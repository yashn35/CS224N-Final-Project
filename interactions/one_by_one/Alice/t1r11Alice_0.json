    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoat is the most important item because it can offer crucial protection from the extreme heat and sun exposure during the day and from the cold temperatures at night. In the Atacama Desert, daytime temperatures can soar to dangerous levels, making heatstroke and dehydration significant risks. An overcoat for everyone will help mitigate these risks by providing some shade and reducing water loss through sweat, improving chances of survival until rescue or reaching the mining camp."
