    "item": "Torch with 4 battery-cells",
    "explanation": "In a barren and flat desert environment, the torch will be crucial to signal for help at night when visibility is low. It will also be useful for navigation once the sun sets, reducing the risk of injury while moving through the desert. This increases the chances of being spotted by potential rescuers or finding the way to the mining camp."
