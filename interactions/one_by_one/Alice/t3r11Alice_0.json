    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "In the extreme heat of the Atacama Desert, protecting oneself from the sun is crucial to avoid heatstroke and severe dehydration. The overcoat can be used to create shade and reduce body temperature, which is essential for survival until rescue or reaching help. Additionally, temperatures in the desert can drop significantly at night, making the overcoat valuable for warmth during the cooler hours."
