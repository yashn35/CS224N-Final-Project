    "explanation": "Visibility and signaling for rescue are crucial in a survival situation, especially when you're off-course and not expected at your current location. The torch can help us navigate safely at night when temperatures drop, and the batteries can be used to create a signal fire or other visible markers. Additionally, the torch can help us signal for help during the night if any search teams come looking."
