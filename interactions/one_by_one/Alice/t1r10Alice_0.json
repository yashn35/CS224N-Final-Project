    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoat will provide essential protection against the harsh sun and extreme temperatures in the Atacama Desert, which can reach up to 130 F at ground level. This will help in preventing heatstroke and sunburn, which are immediate threats to survival. Additionally, at night, temperatures in the desert can drop significantly, and the overcoat will help maintain body warmth."
