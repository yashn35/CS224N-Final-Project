    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoat is essential because it provides protection from the extreme daytime heat and the cold nighttime temperatures in the Atacama Desert. It can shield the body from harmful UV rays and prevent dehydration by reducing direct sunlight exposure. Additionally, it can be used to trap dew at night, offering a potential water source, and can serve as a makeshift shelter, enhancing overall survival chances."
