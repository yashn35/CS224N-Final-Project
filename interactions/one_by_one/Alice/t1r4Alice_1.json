    "explanation": "In the vast and featureless Atacama Desert, maintaining a consistent direction towards the mining camp is critical for survival. The magnetic compass ensures that we do not waste precious energy and resources wandering aimlessly, which could be catastrophic given the extreme temperatures and limited water supply. Accurate navigation greatly increases our chances of reaching the mining camp and finding help."
