    "explanation": "In the Atacama Desert, temperatures drop drastically at night, making lighting critical for both signaling and navigation. The torch will help us locate and avoid dangerous areas, as well as serve as a potential signal for rescue parties. Additionally, the battery-cells could be useful for other survival tactics, such as creating a spark to start a fire."
