    "item": "Parachute (red & white)",
    "explanation": "The parachute can be used to create immediate and much-needed shelter from the intense sun, reducing the risk of severe dehydration or heatstroke. Its bright colors make it an excellent signal for search and rescue operations, increasing the chance of being spotted by aerial or distant ground teams. Additionally, the material can be repurposed for various survival needs, such as collecting dew or creating additional protective clothing."
