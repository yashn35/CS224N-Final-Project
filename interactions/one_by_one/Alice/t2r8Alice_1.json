    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "In the Atacama Desert, overcoats are essential for protecting against the extreme heat during the day and the significant temperature drop at night. They can be used to create shade, preventing heatstroke and dehydration, and to maintain body warmth when temperatures plummet after sunset. Additionally, overcoats provide a versatile fabric that can be utilized for other purposes, such as signaling for rescue or collecting dew."
