    "explanation": "The parachute is critical because it offers both immediate and long-term survival benefits. Its bright colors make it an excellent signaling tool for rescue teams searching from the air, significantly increasing your chances of being spotted. Furthermore, it can provide much-needed shade from the extreme desert heat, helping to prevent heatstroke and conserving your energy and water by reducing direct sun exposure."
