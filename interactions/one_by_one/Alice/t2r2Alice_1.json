    "item": "Plastic raincoat (large size)",
    "explanation": "The plastic raincoat is crucial for survival because it can be utilized to create a solar still, a life-saving method for generating drinkable water from the limited moisture in the air and ground. Water is absolutely essential in the extremely hot and arid conditions of the Atacama Desert to prevent dehydration. Additionally, the raincoat can offer shade and protect from the harsh sun, helping to further reduce the risk of heatstroke."
