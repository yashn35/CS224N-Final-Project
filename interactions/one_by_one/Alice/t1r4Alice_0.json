    "explanation": "The Atacama Desert's extreme sunlight can cause severe eye damage, leading to vision impairment or blindness, which would be catastrophic for our survival. Sunglasses will help protect our eyes from the harsh UV rays and reduce glare, enabling us to navigate and utilize other resources more effectively. Preserving our vision is critical for finding shelter, signaling for help, and making our journey towards the mining camp."
