    "item": "Overcoat (for everyone)",
    "explanation": "The overcoat is the most important item because it provides essential protection from the extreme daytime heat and nighttime cold of the Atacama Desert. It can be used to create makeshift sunshades during the day, preventing heatstroke and conserving energy, as well as insulating everyone against the drastic temperature drops at night to avoid hypothermia. Ensuring adequate protection from the harsh environmental conditions is critical to increase the chances of survival until rescue or when making the trek to the mining camp."
